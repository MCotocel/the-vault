<h1 id="fighting-against-the-colossal">Fighting against the
colossal</h1>
<p>This system is influenced by the various pieces of pop culture that
show massive creatures toppling cities. From Godzilla to the Shadow of
the Colossus to Pacific Rim, these monstrous creatures are epic in scale
and size, and the vanilla combat of D&amp;D 5e just can't properly show
off such an epic encounter.</p>
<p>When fighting these massive creatures, pop culture depicts them as
the colossal monsters whose footsteps can topple towers, rip trees from
the mountain tops, and seemingly ignore hundreds and thousands of arrows
shot into them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in D&amp;D these mighty beasts can be brought low if
you just have enough house cats to swarm them, their claws dealing a
single point of damage, which can bring low even a mighty ancient red
dragon, you just need enough sacrificial house cats - 10,920 to be
exact.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-colossals">What Are Colossals?</h2>
<p>Colossals can be any monster that the DM wishes to turn into a more
exciting battle. A low-level party attempting to kill a giant might use
these rules to turn the fight into a greater cinematic experience, or a
massive tarrasque could be storming a city, thus explaining why a
thousand guards are unable to put an end to the beast with their feeble
crossbows, even with clerics blessing their shots.</p>
<p>Not every monster should be considered suitable for these Colossal
rules, especially if the party has fought and killed many of the same
monsters in the past. Typically, a colossal is a creature of a higher CR
compared to the party and is as much a hazard to the world as a hazard
to the party.</p>
<h2 id="damage-reduction">Damage Reduction</h2>
<p>Damage Reduction allows a creature to reduce the damage it takes by a
certain amount, this amount is determined by the difference in size
between the attacking creature and the colossal creature.</p>
<h3 id="two-size-categories-larger">Two Size Categories Larger</h3>
<p>If a colossal creature is two sizes larger than the attacking
creature, they gain Damage Reduction equal to half their CR to all
attacks made against them.</p>
<h3 id="three-size-categories-larger">Three Size Categories Larger</h3>
<p>If a colossal is three size categories larger or more than the
attacking creature, they gain Damage Reduction equal to their CR to all
attacks made against them.</p>

<h2 id="climbing-the-colossal">Climbing the Colossal</h2>
<p>By climbing on top of a colossal, you can affect the creature in
different ways depending on where you are. There are three categories to
decide where you are when you climb on a creature. It is assumed that
you first climb onto a creature by first moving on to its legs, as they
are typically the only parts connected to the ground. You can then move
from the legs to the body, and from the body to the head.</p>
<p>While a smaller creature has climbed onto a larger creature, the
smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack
rolls.</p>
<h3 id="making-the-climb">Making the Climb</h3>
<p>A smaller creature that is two sizes smaller than a larger creature
can attempt to begin climbing the larger creature. The smaller creature
can attempt to make a special Attack action to make a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller
creature successfully moves into the creature's space and is clinging on
to the larger creature's body. If you are able to make multiple attacks
with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>
<p>The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's
space, treating the space as difficult terrain. It is assumed that the
smaller creature first grabs onto the larger creature's legs but the DM
may rule otherwise depending on any special circumstances. The larger
creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller
creature's location, and is left to the DM's discretion. The larger
creature can dislodge the smaller creature as a special Attack action -
knocking it off, scraping it against wall, or grabbing and throwing it -
by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller
creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The
smaller creature chooses which ability to use. If the creature is able
able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack
replaces one of them.</p>
<h3 id="climbing-higher">Climbing Higher</h3>
<p>If the smaller creature wishes to climb higher up the creature to the
next section of its body, like from the legs to the body, they must
repeat the special Attack action they used to climb onto the colossal.
On a success, they can use their movement to climb up the larger
creature to the next section of its body. On a failure, they are knocked
off and fall to the ground, suffering falling damage if they were 10
feet or more off the ground.</p>
<p>The DM may decide, based on the arrangement of the larger creature,
that a smaller creature can climb from the legs to the head, or can
climb on to the head first.</p>
<h3 id="descending">Descending</h3>
<p>When descending from a larger creature, the smaller creature can
choose to climb down safely, repeating the steps for climbing up a
creature, or they can choose to fall and try to catch themselves. They
repeat the same special Attack action as if they were climbing up the
creature, but if they decide to fall, they have disadvantage when making
their check. On a success they can grab on to the larger creature to any
spot that is below them, this movement allows them to move faster as
they do not have to use their movement to fall. On a failed check, they
plummet to the ground and take falling damage based on how far they
fell.</p>
<h2 id="teleporting-and-flight">Teleporting and Flight</h2>
<p>If a creature wishes to teleport or fly up to the top of a creature
and grab on, they must still take the special Attack action in order to
cling to the colossal. If they fail the check, they fall to the ground
unless they have some way of keeping themselves aloft. The DM may decide
that there are certain spots on a colossal creature that don't require
the check, but most creatures are in constant motion and those
circumstances would be very rare.</p>
<h2 id="legs">Legs</h2>
<p>While a creature is clinging to a colossal's legs, the smaller
creature can attempt to make a special Attack action to slice at the
muscles in the creature's legs. When the smaller creature makes an
attack and is successful against the AC of the creature, they roll
damage and if they would deal damage, they can choose to instead
decrease the creature's movement speed with their legs by 5 feet instead
of dealing damage. If you are able to make multiple attacks with the
Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>
<p>The larger creature's movement is divided equally between the number
of its legs. You can reduce a single leg's movement up to the maximum of
that leg's movement. A creature, whose movement is reduced to 0 must
either change how it moves or is knocked prone and can only move by
crawling until it is healed. You can climb on to the head or body of a
creature that is prone if you are on the ground.</p>
<p>While the smaller creature has climbed onto the legs, it can climb up
to the body.</p>
<h2 id="body">Body</h2>
<p>The smaller creature treats the colossal as if it is one size smaller
for the purposes of Damage Reduction. While the smaller creature is on
the body, it can climb up to the head or down to the legs.</p>
<h2 id="head">Head</h2>
<p>A smaller creature clinging to a colossal's head can attempt to make
a special Attack action to maim the colossal. When a smaller creature
makes an attack, it can instead target a sensory organ that provides
information to the larger creature so long as it is within reach. If
they make a successful attack roll against the AC of the larger
creature, they can deal damage to the sensory organ instead of the
colossal. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack
action, this attack replaces one of them.</p>
<p>A creature must be on the head of a colossal in order to target the
sensory organs, and they can not use an attack that targets an area of
effect. While the smaller creature is on the head, it can climb down to
the body.</p>
<h2 id="attacking-sensory-organs">Attacking Sensory Organs</h2>
<p>A creature that targets a sensory organ must make a successful attack
roll against the AC of the colossal, on a successful, they can deal
damage to that sensory organ instead of dealing damage to the colossal.
Once an organ is reduced to 0 hit points, that sensory organ no longer
works. Some sensory organs have redundancies, like having two eyes or
two ears, and requires an attacker to destroy both in order to destroy
the sensory organs.</p>
<p>The chart below provides suggestions for the hit points of sensory
organs. Each lot of hit points represents a single part of the sensory
organ, so if a colossal has three eyes, each eye has the amount of hit
points listed below. Certain colossal have an incredible amount of
redundancies in their sensory organs that make targeting pointless, like
the eight legs of a spider or the thousand eyes of an ancient elder
evil.</p>
<p>The DM may decide that a sensory organ is not destroyed at 0 hit
points and that if the creature receives magical healing, the sensory
organ's hit points can be restored. This does not heal the colossal,
only the sensory organ's hit points. A regenerate spell immediately
restores all sensory organs.</p>
<p>Sensory organs do not gain any form of damage reduction unless the DM
determines that there is something unique about them that would grant
them that reduction, like armored eyelids or it's bones are made out of
a strange substance that dissuades normal attacks.</p>

<h3 id="destroyed-sensory-organs">Destroyed Sensory Organs</h3>
<p>Destroying one of the sensory organs above might have one of the
following effects on a colossal, or the DM may decide on something else
might be more appropriate.</p>
<h4 id="eyes">Eyes</h4>
<p>The colossal is blinded.</p>
<h4 id="ear">Ear</h4>
<p>The colossal is deafened.</p>
<h4 id="nose">Nose</h4>
<p>The colossal can't smell for the purpose of perception checks.</p>
<h4 id="feelers-tentacles">Feelers / Tentacles</h4>
<p>Eyestalks, tentacles and more are destroyed. This could have a
variety of effects from blinding a creature to removing a way for them
to attack.</p>
<h4 id="jaw-beak">Jaw / Beak</h4>
<p>This might provide disadvantage on any attacks made with a mouth, or
destroy it all together depending on the colossal and it's anatomy.</p>
<h4 id="trunk">Trunk</h4>
<p>This might provide disadvantage on any attacks made with a trunk, or
destroy it all together depending on the colossal and it's anatomy.</p>
<h2 id="siege-monsters-weapons">Siege Monsters &amp; Weapons</h2>
<p>Siege equipment and monsters can more easily destroy a colossal
monster. Siege weapons and creatures with the Siege Monster trait treat
a colossal creature as one size smaller for the purposes of Damage
Reduction.</p>
<h2 id="colossal-monsters">Colossal Monsters</h2>
<p>The chart below provides rough guidelines for creatures that could be
used as a colossal encounter. This chart provides the height of the
legs, the body, and the head. This can be helpful for determining how
much movement a character must spend to climb onto the monster as well
as to move up to the head of a creature.</p>

<h2 id="running-colossal-combat">Running Colossal Combat</h2>
<p>It may be helpful to help visualise the colossal creature by having
another battlemap with the creature drawn out on a grid. Then, when a
smaller creature begins climbing them, move their token to the other
battlemap to represent where they are on the colossal.</p>
<h2 id="variant-rule-extra-attacks">Variant Rule: Extra Attacks</h2>
<p>To help with lower damage that is spread out across multiple attacks,
the DM can decide that all attacks that are made as part of an Attack
action count as a single source of damage when it comes to damage
reduction so long as those attacks are made on the same spot on the
colossal. If a creature moves to different locations on a colossal and
strikes at different parts of the colossal, each attack is subjected to
damage reduction.</p>
<p>This also applies to monks who spend a ki point to do their flurry of
blows ability, their Bonus Action attacks count as a single source of
damage for the purposes of damage reduction.</p>
<p>This variant rule may not make sense for every colossal creature and
is up to the DM's discretion.</p>
<h2 id="variant-rule-dangerous-position">Variant Rule: Dangerous
Position</h2>
<p>Whenever a character is on a colossal creature and takes damage, they
must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw to maintain holding onto
the colossal creature. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take,
whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources,
such as a bite and a slam, you make a separate saving throw for each
source of damage. Variant Rule: Ranged Attacks</p>
<p>While this type of encounter is geared towards characters climbing up
on a massive creature and risking their lives to a sudden fall, ranged
characters might feel a little left out. To allow them to target sensory
organs on the top of the colossal without climbing up, the DM can rule
that they simply need to get to high ground that is at a similar height
to what sensory organ they want to target. This might be a massive tree,
a crumbling stone tower, or other objects and structures around the
battlefield.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-running-a-colossal">Tips for Running a Colossal</h2>
<p>Colossal creatures do not exist in a vacuum and the DM should put
some thought as to what else is going on outside of the colossal. Are
there minions swooping in trying to knock off the climbers? Are there
people in need of rescue? Certain characters will outshine others when
it comes to taking down a colossal, and a DM should have other risks and
challenges inside of the encounter to encourage everyone at the table to
react against the colossal. Traps must be sprung, minions shot down, and
civilians saved from the hulking monsters.</p>
