<h1 id="the-white-room">The white room</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A home is an important thing to have. While there have certainly been
no small share of meaningful individuals who roam from place to place or
simply live on the road, there is a sense of security from having a
place to call your own that few other things can offer. This is not
limited to just the societies of sapients either, for there are many
simple animals that are proud owners of a den. Some, such as the snail
or tortoise, take things a step further and bring their home with them
on their back, ready to retreat into at a moment’s notice. Of course,
the downside is that their shells are cumbersome things, and offer no
room to manoeuvre or fight back once inside. But there is another
creature that carries its home with it that has neither of these
weaknesses. It moves like a wisp of smoke, and its lair is no mere
shelter. It is a proper domain, like the den of a lion or the hive of a
wasp, and those who foolishly enter it will find themselves at the mercy
of the White Room.</p>
<p>The creature and its lair share the same name, for they are
inexorably linked together, two parts of the same whole. Some have
theorised that the room is in fact some part of the monster’s body,
placed and expanded through some strange spatial distortion. This theory
holds some credence, as the two have a similar appearance. The monster
is a lithe, hairy beast with a coat of stark-white fur, bright and pure
as snow. The only hint of colour is the two beady blood-red eyes that
peer out from the head. The creature’s razor-sharp claws and teeth are
retractable, perfectly adapted to quietly slip out and take a life,
taking care not to stain its coat until the final bloody blow. The
chamber that it preys in is an empty room of the same blinding white,
allowing for perfect camouflage. No shadows are present in this
colourless void, making the geometry of the lair impossible to read even
if it didn’t seem to change constantly, the shifting walls serving to
let the beast hide and corral its victims. This confusion is paramount
in the monster’s hunting strategy, using its prey’s own perception as a
weapon against them.</p>
<p>The White Room’s abilities are unique, but so are its behaviours and
utilisation of such. With a portable lair comes many opportunities, so
the clever monster takes full advantage of the element of surprise,
setting up a trap for more intelligent prey. It slinks into a building
in the dead of night, its wispy fur silhouetted against the darkness,
and finds its first door. A certain door, chosen for reasons we can’t
entirely understand. And then it gets to work. The process by which the
White Room implants its lair is unknown, as it has never been observed.
It is a slow process, taking nearly an hour, but once done there is
little to no trace of the tampering, save for thin strands of white
gathered around the doorframe. The trap is complete. Then, the hunt
begins properly. The monster seems to prefer killing in the safety of
its lair, even if there is ample opportunity to silence a sleeping
victim forever. Perhaps it is some anxious instinct, perhaps the monster
takes advantage of the chamber as a storeroom for its food, or perhaps
the lair is the beast’s very stomach itself. A chilling thought.
Regardless, the White Room utilises its full cunning to lure or chase
prey to one of its chosen gateways. Now, whenever an unsuspecting victim
opens the door, they shall find only a blank chamber… with the exit far
on the other side. Tempting them. Waiting for them. And the monster
hidden in plain sight, eager to make the pure white floor blossom
red.</p>
<h2 id="how-and-when-to-use-it">How and When to use it</h2>
<p>The White Room is a very visual monster, so understandably some of
its abilities are also best described via visuals. I’ll be including
some diagrams in the google drive version to explain some of the weirder
aspects of the monster.</p>
<p>The major mechanic/theme of an encounter with the White Room is not
being able to trust your eyes. However, whereas that phrase usually
entails being given false positives (illusions, holograms, disguises,
etc) the White Room instead gives false negatives. Instead of seeing a
wall where there is none, they see a none where there is wall (that
sentence is the closest I’ve ever come to having a stroke). It also
isn’t anything as simple as invisibility, which could potentially be
seen through with spells or by watching for footprints, although it
achieves the same effect. The end goal is stranding the players in an
informationless void, where they have to scramble to latch onto the
slightest scrap that will let them get out of there alive. Withholding
information is an excellent way to generate fear, especially when
there’s a threat at hand that they know they need that information to
defeat. The information in this case is the monster’s position, so focus
on obscuring and rapidly changing that as much as possible.</p>
<p>The White Room is nothing without its namesake lair, so you’re gonna
have to find some way to ensure that they at least encounter the lair.
You can’t force them to go through, but you can sure as hell incentivise
it. While they’re sleeping through the night at a mansion/inn/jail/what
have you, have the monster sneak in and install its trap in some doors.
Preferably in the way of all of their possible routes out of the
building. A normal long rest is 8 hours, so you’ll have around 8 doors
to work with, or half of that if there’s an elf in the party who tends
to snoop around. So when the gang goes out to resume their
adventure/find out where the other guests got off to, they’ll open the
door as normal and suddenly be greeted by a very different scene.
Obviously, they may not initially choose to go through, so have the
active door shift around to cut them off, only confusing them more and
more as various doors alternate between normalcy and a white void. If
you really need to, and if you think the party will fall for it,
consider having the monster itself exit the chamber and try to chase
them in. Remember, it can change the active door even when it’s not
inside the chamber itself. This could also potentially be used to allow
the White Room to rapidly move around the larger structure, popping into
the demiplane before changing the door and popping back out somewhere
else. This will lead to a terrifying chase scene where the monster keeps
cutting the party off at every turn, adapting to their movements on the
fly and herding them towards its lair. If you do this, keep in mind that
while it looks scarier when you can actually see it, it’s actually far
weaker outside of its lair. So, a good strategy would be to use an
Intimidation check to frighten the party first, so that they can’t
approach it to take advantage of its weakness. Desperate to get away,
they’ll eventually be left with no choice but to run, right into its
white chamber of death.</p>
<p>Now, nothing screams “trap” like a perfectly empty room popping up
out of nowhere. Which will only put the party’s nerves more on edge when
they finally go through (that is, if they don’t decide to jump out a
window or something instead and take some fat ankle-shattering damage).
So they’ll be going through, likely expecting an ambush. And they’ll be
right, of course! But just because they could see it coming doesn’t mean
they’ll be able to see it coming. One of the first moves I’d recommend
making is immediately using Rearrange to block off both exits. It might
take the party a second to even realise what has happened, a white veil
just extending out from the wall and hiding any trace of both the exits
and itself. Doing this will use up two out of the ten allotted walls,
but it’s well worth the price.</p>
<p>Once the party is trapped in the demiplane, there are a couple
different ways you can run things. One smart tactic is immediately using
more Rearrange to split the party up, or at least give the impression
that they’re split up. Placing thin walls between them will block off
their line of sight to each other, and even if they could still easily
turn the corner to find each other, the fact that they can’t see where a
wall starts and ends will make it seem like they’re stranded further
away. If you’re really mean, you could completely entrap one party
member with walls on each side, letting the White Room descend on them
to attack with less fear of retaliation. Of course, if the White Room
can get to the victim the other party members probably can too, provided
they can locate them and navigate the invisible geometry. Another
potential way to introduce the White Room is to have it break camouflage
for just a moment, blinking its red eyes and opening its razor grin. The
trick is, only have it reveal itself to one party member. Then, you can
have the classic “Guys, over there!” and when the rest turn to look, it
has gone back to blending in. But now, everyone is conveniently looking
in one direction, possibly admonishing the bell-ringer, providing an
excellent opportunity for it to sneak attack them.</p>
<p>No matter how you introduce it, you should always be trying to keep
the White Room on the move. Attacking reveals its position, after all,
so keep darting around. It won’t provoke attacks of opportunity if the
players still can’t pick it out from the environment, so don’t worry
about that. Hit-and-run tactics are your friend, both strategically and
in giving the party a sense of dread. Go more aggressive as long as the
White Room is clean, and if it gets dirtied then have it focus on
breaking line of sight and cleaning itself up. Of course, if it has to
use its lair action to clean itself then it can’t rearrange the
demiplane, removing an element of uncertainty for another round and
allowing the players to fight back! The more the players mark up the
clean, white chamber, the more of an advantage they’ll gain. Throwing
splashes of colour around is a great way for them to visually measure
their progress, and is also nice and satisfying. If the White Room gets
below half health, it may also get sloppier and angrier, using Spill
Blood far more frequently, only adding to whatever mess the party has
already created. However, consider having the White Room be the first
one to paint on the empty canvas. The sudden, intense violence of Spill
Blood on an otherwise pristine battlefield is an excellent sudden shock,
and a good way to startle players into action. You’ll always get at
least one shot at using it, and every time you land it the fight will
last just a bit longer. It’s a powerful weapon and more importantly, a
reminder to the players that this is the monster’s playing field. And
they are not the ones in control.</p>
<p>In short, the White Room is a monster that brings its lair with it
wherever it goes. It is a living trap that no matter how much the party
might see it coming, they will still be caught off guard by.</p>
<h2 id="white-room">White Room</h2>

<h3 id="white-void">White Void</h3>
<p>The White Room has a demiplane connected to it taking the form of an
entirely empty, bright white cubical chamber made out of an unknown
solid material, 90 ft across on all sides. The entire chamber is filled
with bright light, rendering it shadowless, and can be used to trigger
the Sunlight Sensitivity trait. There are two entrances to and from the
demiplane while it is active, located opposite from each other on the
edges of the chamber. Organic material does not rot within the
demiplane. In order to create an entrance to the demiplane, the White
Room must spend 1 hour uninterrupted affixing itself to any functional
door that fulfills certain criteria. The door must be solid, with no
gaps or windows, and both sides of the door must open into an enclosed
space. Magically protected doors cannot be connected to. The White Room
can have any number of doors attached to the demiplane, but only one
door may actively lead into the demiplane at a time. If a door is
active, then upon opening the door it will open into the demiplane
instead of its normal destination, with the exit on the other side. The
White Room knows the locations of all creatures within its demiplane at
all times, and automatically succeeds any Perception checks made while
inside the chamber. The demiplane is disconnected from the outside world
if the White Room falls unconscious, dies, or chooses to deactivate it.
When deactivated, all living creatures in the demiplane are ejected out
through the last door on which it was active, including the White Room
itself if it chooses. The White Room may freely travel to and from its
demiplane even when disconnected, in exchange for taking 2 levels of
Exhaustion upon doing so. If it exits the demiplane in this way, it is
teleported to a random location within 5 miles of the most recent
entrance to the demiplane. If the demiplane is destroyed by any means,
the White Room dies, and its body collapses in on itself.</p>
<h3 id="pure-white">Pure White</h3>
<p>The White Room blends in perfectly to its chamber, aside from its
eyes. If it is clean and has no other colors or identifying marks on it,
it is treated as Invisible while in its lair. Upon dealing damage, it
must make a DC 14 Sleight Of Hand check to avoid dirtying itself with
blood in order to maintain this invisibility. It automatically fails
this check if it uses Spill Blood. It is dirtied whenever it takes
slashing, piercing, fire, acid, necrotic or lightning damage, or when a
creature marks it by any other clearly visible means. The White Room may
make a DC 20 Stealth check as an action to clean itself up.</p>
<h3 id="blind-spot">Blind Spot</h3>
<p>While hidden or Invisible, the White Room has advantage on attack
rolls. In addition, as long as it is hidden, Invisible or no other
creatures have a line of sight to it, it may instantly move to any other
point within its chamber that fulfills these conditions by using 20 ft
of its movement.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<h4 id="multiattack">Multiattack</h4>
<p>The White Room makes two attacks with its Claws. If it has a target
grappled, it may instead use its Spill Blood. If it is below half of its
maximum HP, it may make one Claw attack and one Spill Blood attack if it
grapples with the first attack.</p>
<h4 id="claws">Claws</h4>
<p>Melee weapon attack, +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, single target. 1D8+2
slashing damage, on hit the White Room can choose to grapple a target
(escape DC 14) instead of dealing damage.</p>
<h4 id="spill-blood">Spill Blood</h4>
<p>(Recharge 4-6) Melee weapon attack, +5 to hit, reach 5 ft, single
target. 3D8+2 piercing damage, on hit the White Room is dirtied, and
until the end of their next long rest the target’s max HP is reduced by
half of the damage dealt. The White Room also gains temporary HP of the
same amount. If this attack misses, it automatically recharges.</p>
<h3 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h3>
<h4 id="relocate">Relocate</h4>
<p>The current active door to and from the demiplane is changed to any
other door within the same structure that the White Room has
successfully connected with. This ability can be used even if the White
Room is not within the demiplane, as long as it is within the same
structure.</p>
<h4 id="rearrange">Rearrange</h4>
<p>Up to five 5 ft x 10 ft walls invisibly extrude from any static
surface in any clean, unoccupied and unmarked location. The walls can be
between 1 inch and 5 ft thick, and can be placed in any orientation.
Instead of creating a wall, an existing wall may be removed. The maximum
number of walls that can be placed at any given time is 10, at which
point any new walls will require an old one to be removed. The walls
count as total cover, and block vision. The location of the walls cannot
be determined by creatures other than the White Room unless they pass a
DC 17 Perception check, which is reduced to DC 10 if the wall is
dirtied.</p>
<h4 id="blank-slate">Blank Slate</h4>
<p>(1/Day) The White Room removes any marks or stains from either
itself, or from an area no larger than a 10 ft cube. This does not
require any checks or rolls.</p>
