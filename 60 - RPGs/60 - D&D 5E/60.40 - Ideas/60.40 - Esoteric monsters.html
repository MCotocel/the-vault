<h1 id="esoteric-monsters">Esoteric monsters</h1>
<p>This is a system of templates to makes monsters more dangerous,
unique and memorable. In essence, it makes them exceedingly hard to
damage outside of a specific <strong>esoteric weakness</strong>. Battles
with this monsters often play out as one part fight and one part puzzle
- tackling these monsters without research and preparation is often all
but impossible and they should not be carelessly unleashed on an
unprepared party.</p>
<p>Remember, it is up to the DM to make the encounter possible by
providing the tools and clues to win.</p>
<h2 id="immunity-grade">Immunity Grade</h2>
<p>The first element of an Esoteric Monster is to make it far harder to
kill with traditional means. This is a template placed on top of the
monster's other stats, and comes in the levels found below. In the
following table "DR" stands for "Damage Reduction"; damage reduction is
a rarely used mechanic in 5e (for good reason) but is appropriate for
what we are trying to do here, and is subtracted from any damage done to
a creature before any other effect takes place.</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 7%" />
<col style="width: 92%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Immunity Grade</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Low</td>
<td>The creature has a DR of 10.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Moderate</td>
<td>The creature has immunity to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing
damage, a DR of 15, immunity to spells 5th level or below, and Legendary
Resistance equal to its proficiency bonus.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Absolute</td>
<td>The creature has immunity to all damage types, is immune to all
magic effects, and has unlimited use of Legendary Resistance.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Magic Resistance grants advantage on saving throws against magical
effects. The purposes of Immunity Grade, magical effects include effects
from Magic, Spells, Psionics, Ki, and other supernatural sources.</p>
<h2 id="esoteric-weakness">Esoteric Weakness</h2>
<p>At the heart of this concept and style of design is that these
creatures possess a fatal flaw that renders them vulnerable. An esoteric
weakness can range from a convenient way to bring down the monster to
the only real way to harm the creature.</p>
<p>You can roll from the table below, or select one that is appropriate
to the creature (or even make your own that fits the creature and
narrative!)</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Damage dealt in the condition that matches a creature's weakness
bypasses it's immunity grade effects. For example, if a creature's
esoteric weakness is moonlight, if it takes damage while in direct
moonlight, it would be vulnerable to that damage and that damage would
bypass it's immunity grade.</p>
<p>A creature's vulnerability to its weakness is inversely proportional
to it's immunity grade; a creature always has vulnerability to damage
dealt in a way that matches its weakness, but a creature with a moderate
or absolute immunity grade additionally treats any damage dealt by it as
an automatic critical hit.</p>
<h2 id="source-of-power">Source of Power</h2>
<p>One consideration that should always come up in this sort of
encounter is the source of the monster's immunity grade, esoteric
powers, and esoteric weakness.</p>
<p>For a low immunity grade, perhaps it is a goblin that blessed (or
cursed) by a powerful fey or spirit. This sort of fight can be overcome
without learning its weakness (as long as the immunity grade is low). An
absolute immunity grade is usually the boon of a god and is often given
to a suitably epic recipient, though not always. An encounter against a
goblin Achilles with an Absolute immunity grade would be memorable!</p>
<p>Other frequent sources include beings from the far realm to which
normal logic does not apply, fey creatures that follow their own rules,
or "a wizard did it".</p>
<h2 id="clues">Clues</h2>
<p>A critical part of running an esoteric monster is cluing the party
into the fact that you are running an esoteric monster. The first time a
monster like this is used, it's not a bad idea to simply tell the
players (particularly ones familiar with 5e combat) that they will
encounter a monster that follows unique rules and warn them they will
need additional information to fight the monster.</p>
<p>You can (and should) offer less fourth wall breaking clues. Terrified
tales of a creature that cannot be injured. Reports of arrows bouncing
off it harmlessly, it leaping through walls of fire unscathed, etc.</p>
<p>A popular technique is to let the party fight it briefly, but have it
disengage, running away - it is not interested in the party. They may
choose to hunt it, but if they wish to, they'll have to figure out why
their attacks seemed to do nothing to it.</p>
<h2 id="challenge-rating">Challenge Rating</h2>
<p>The challenge rating system provides no real tools for engaging a
monster like this, as it's challenge rating is intentionally excessive
when its weakness is unknown, and often weaker than its more mundane
counterparts should the players be prepared for it. This template has no
standardised impact on the creature's CR.</p>
<p>That said, a DM should consider that these fights have an extra
element of challenge to them that is not reflected in the CR system and
take that into consideration when deploying monsters of this type.</p>
<h2 id="special-powers">Special Powers</h2>
<p>The following are not necessarily to build an esoteric monster, but
can add to the challenge and serve as the basis for making the monster a
larger threat, or more difficult to deal with. Some groups may have
little trouble dealing with a monster that is simply hard to kill, so
adding a few of these can ensure that an esoteric monster remains an
appropriate challenge. You can either roll on the table, or select
powers that may vex your player's favourite tactics:</p>
<table>

<col style="width: 99%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>d8</th>
<th>Special Powers</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>At the start of each of its turns, the creature teleports 5 feet in
a direction of its choosing.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>As a reaction to taking damage that doesn't trigger its esoteric
weakness, the monster enters the ethereal plane until the start of its
next turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>The creature can add double its proficiency bonus to athletics
checks, and can contest a grapple check at the start of its turns
without expending an action.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td>The creature is exudes a supernaturally terrifying presence. Any
creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the esoteric creature
while being able to see it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + [2 x
the creature's proficiency bonus]) or become frightened until the start
of their next turn.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5</td>
<td>The creature gains the ability to cast any spell cast within 60 feet
of it, gaining one use of that spell it can cast without expending a
spell slot, mimicing the casters spell casting modifiers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>6</td>
<td>After a creature takes damage of a damage type not of its esoteric
weakness, it absorbs further instances of that damage type until the
start of its next turn (regaining hit points equal to the damage taken
from it).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>7</td>
<td>The creature is always invisible.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>8</td>
<td>The creature gains a number of Legendary Actions equal to half its
proficiency bonus (rounded up) that it can use to make a single attack
available to it or move up to its movement speed (this should not be
applied to monsters that already have Legendary Actions).</td>
</tr>
