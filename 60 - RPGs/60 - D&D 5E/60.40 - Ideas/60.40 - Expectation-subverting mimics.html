<h1 id="expectation-subverting-mimics">Expectation-subverting
mimics</h1>
<p>So you wanna throw a Mimic in your campaign, awesome! They're spooky
and neat. Sadly, their radness has given them fame as one of D&amp;d's
most famous monsters, and players are (through no real fault of their
own) more cognisant of them than their characters would be.</p>
<p>So let's subvert those expectations, pull the rug out from accidental
meta-gaming, and make a tasty little recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 part danger</li>
<li>3 parts paranoia</li>
<li>1 part naive innocence</li>
<li>81 parts horror and spookyness. (Halloween is stil going on, right?
Right?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some fun unconventional mimics for you to throw at your
party. Some inspired by memes or posts I've seen here before:</p>
<h2 id="the-health-potion-mimic">The Health Potion Mimic</h2>
<ul>
<li>The dead adventurer's last undrunk healing potion. Labelled for
convenience, and often found near a skeleton (its last victim) and
broken glass (its previous moulting).</li>
</ul>
<p>This tiny sized Mimic needs an intentional DC14 investigation check
to determine that its red liquid seems thicker than usual, and DC 19 to
see part of the potion bottle itself shiver and move.</p>
<p>This bad boy/girl/nightmare waits for you to put it to your mouth,
then digs its needle-like talons into your gums and deposits its eggs
into your throat.</p>
<p>The unfortunate soul then must make DC 16 CON saves every hour until
they succeed or fail 3. On success, the eggs are dissolved by the body's
natural acid. On a failure, the victim takes 10d6 bludgeoning damage as
3 newly spawned mimics burst from their gut.</p>
<h2 id="the-copper-coin-mimic">The Copper Coin Mimic</h2>
<ul>
<li>Found nestled among copper coins on a bench or on the floor of a
jail cell. When put into a coin purse, consumes gold pieces at 1 GP per
day, per Mimic, and replicates itself in a similar fashion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, if an Adventurer has 100 gold, on day 1 there is 1 Mimic.
It eats 1 gold coin and replicates. Sack has 2 mimics and 99 gold.</p>
<ul>
<li>Day 2 there are 2 mimics. They eat and replicate. 4 mimics, 97
gold.</li>
<li>Day 3. 4 mimics. Eat, replicate. 8 &amp; 93 gold.</li>
<li>Day 4. 8 eat. - &gt; 16 &amp; 85 gold.</li>
<li>Day 5. 16 eat. - &gt; 32 &amp; 69 gold.</li>
<li>Day 6. 32 eat. - &gt; 64 &amp; 37 gold.</li>
<li>Day 7. 37 eat. - &gt; 101 mimics, no gold, and one very confused
adventurer.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Allow perception checks whenever player pays for something to notice
the shift in coinage. Easier checks as copper increases. Leave it up to
the player to discover what is happening.)</p>
<h2 id="the-wand-mimic">The Wand Mimic</h2>
<p>A +2 potent wand, appearing to be made out of obsidian and rosewood.
Every time the player casts a 4th level spell slot or higher, there is a
chance the spell slot is wasted, and a chest Mimic is spawned within 15
feet. The higher the spell slot used, the more likely the chance of a
Mimic appearing.</p>
<ul>
<li>4th - 5%</li>
<li>5th - 10%</li>
<li>6th - 20%</li>
<li>7th - 33%</li>
<li>8th - 50%</li>
<li>9th - 100%, 20 mimics spawn within 30 ft, and the wand Mimic
explodes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-tripwire-mimic">The Tripwire Mimic</h2>
<p>Taking the form of an amateurly constructed tripwire, this Mimic
waits along hallways in dungeons for an adventurer to come along and
trip over it, or better yet, lean down nice and close to 'disarm'
it.</p>
<p>Any creature that touches the tripwire Mimic is instantly restrained
and begins to choke as the tripwire Mimic tightens around their neck.
Wire-like tendrils allow it to still attack other creatures.</p>
<h2 id="the-mimic-book-mimic">The Mimic Book Mimic</h2>
<p>A strange tome found in an abandoned dusty library of a mad mage.
This book - actually a Mimic itself - creates other mimics by
interacting with ordinary objects.</p>
<p>Though the cover is titled: How to Summon and Control Mimics, it is
written in a coded language, complex and indiscernible from gibberish.
Should comprehend languages be used upon it, it shall be found to be
exceedingly strange, drolling, convoluted, and seems to require at least
a full week's worth of study to fully read (unfortunately, this week of
study will only lead to the conclusion that the book itself is nonsense,
full of useless ravings).</p>
<p>Once per day, the Mimic Book Mimic can magically influence two
randomly chosen non-magical items that are being worn within 30 ft. of
it to manifest themselves as mimics. Once slain, the objects revert back
to their normal state.</p>
<p>The Mimic Book of Mimics is intelligent, and understands all
languages. If it is under threat of being discovered, it can choose not
to create mimics, or delay such creation after its initial discovery, if
the party seems wary of the Book.</p>
<h2 id="the-cage-mimic">The Cage Mimic</h2>
<p>The cage Mimic can be found at abandoned bandit outposts. Structured
like a large iron box, with irons bards for walls, one iron door on a
hinge, and a solid 'metal' ceiling and floor, the cage Mimic can be up
to 10 feet tall. Baiting its trap like an anglerfish, the cage Mimic has
some sort of lure within it. Sometimes it will be a malnourished
half-orc child. Other times, a rotting corpse with magical-looking
manacles on.</p>
<p>The cage Mimic stalks into small bandit camps and consumes all those
unfortunate enough to be caught unaware. Then, the camp now empty and
apparently deserted, the cage Mimic waits. Elder cage mimics have even
been known to emit sounds from their lure, such as a child's pained
cry.</p>
<p>Often waiting for multiple victims to enter the cage at once, the
cage Mimic will strike when it sees the opportunity, or when its lure is
touched. It is at this point that the cage Mimic will fold outward, one
bar-wall of the cage acting as its spine, while all other bars act as
its limbs. It unfolds into a spider-like guise, and can easily traverse
vertical walls.</p>
<p>The cage Mimic is a huge creature when unfolded, and gets 4 attacks:
3 with its bar-limbs, one with its incredibly adhesive lure. Those hit
by the lure are automatically grappled and restrained, taking 4d6 acid
damage at the start of their turn.</p>
