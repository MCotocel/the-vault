<h1 id="the-nightcrawlers">The Nightcrawlers</h1>
<h2 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h2>
<p>To set the quest up, heavy rain must have fallen for several days. It
is also paramount that the quest is performed during a dark night.</p>
<h2 id="hook">Hook</h2>
<p>The quest is found in any town or village. It can be attained through
a town taskboard, word of mouth, or any other method you deem
suitable.</p>
<h2 id="questgiver">Questgiver</h2>
<p>The quest giver can be one or several, but for the sake of
simplicity, let's say there is one.</p>
<p>The questgiver is a farmer who, for a long time, has had his
livestock stolen, often left in gory shreds and is seeking a solution to
the problem. The questgiver will tell the party that
<em>Nightcrawlers</em> have terrorized the village for generations,
stealing food, items and livestock, kidnapping children and killing
villagers who enter the nearby woods. He is relieved and elated that a
group of adventuerer's have finally shown up to bring peace to the
farmlands once and for all.</p>
<p>The village has not had the manpower or resources to deal with the
nightcrawlers. But this task has been further complicated by the fact
that they are burrow dwellers, living in underground tunnels that would
be lethal to enter.</p>
<p>However, the farmer tells them that now is the perfect time to
strike, as he estimates that the extreme rain will soon bring the
monsters out of their burrows as they begin to flood. He instructs the
party to wait for them to surface and then surprise them as they leave.
The quest, at the surface, is nothing more than a kill quest. A kill
quest, with a <em>big tactical advantage</em>. Easy money.</p>
<h2 id="the-quest">The quest</h2>
<p>The grove to which the party must venture is a 20 minute trudge
through the dark and the rain. Here is the description to set the
mood:</p>
<p><em>You venture out of Millstone, with Millbrook Grove in your
sights, and follow into a beaten path leading southwards. You walk
through the humid blackness, feeling your feet quickly drench in the
muddy water below, flashes of lightning illuminating drowning meadows
and steep hillsides as you pray that your light source will not abandon
you in the dark.</em></p>
<p><em>As you pass by a wheat field, another flash erupts, and you see a
figure standing in the middle of the field, staring straight at you. You
can barely register the sight before the dark returns, leaving only an
afterimage of the figure.</em> [On further inspection, it's nothing but
a scarecrow.]</p>
<p><em>You walk onwards, eventually coming to a thickening of the flora,
a dense forest starting by your feet. You manage to find another beaten
path into the Grove.</em></p>
<p>Now arriving at the forest, the adventurers soon come to the target
area:</p>
<p><em>You eventually come into a clearing in the Grove, and as another
strike of lightning flashes up the area in a blinding white light, you
see a number of mounds in the earth before you.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Upon entering the clearing]</strong>: <em>Stepping closer,
you stop at the first mound. You find that it has a hole, large enough
for a small human to fit inside, but not much more.</em></p>
<p><strong>[Upon inspecting the holes]</strong>:<em>Inspecting the other
mounds, you find that there appears to be a total of five of them,
spanning a radius not much more than sixty feet. This must be the
burrow.</em></p>
<p>The task is now simple. They have found the lair of the
nightcrawlers, and unless they're too late, the monsters will soon
surface. All they have to do is wait.</p>
<p>If the party chooses to wait in ambush, the enemy soon surfaces. Here
is how it played out in my party. Keep in mind, they were quite blind in
the dark:</p>
<p><em>Your ears twitch as you hear sound coming from a nearby hole.
It's faint, distant, yet a sound was definitely made.</em></p>
<p><strong>[On waiting]</strong>: <em>The sound comes closer, low grunts
and the shuffling of mud. You feel your hearts in your throats as you
prepare for whatever may emerge, weapons in hand.</em></p>
<p><strong>[On waiting]</strong>: <em>Suddenly, a head emerges from
below, trying to push itself to the surface.</em></p>
<p>You can have the players roll for hit and damage, but make whatever
they are hitting weak enough to almost entirely guarantee one-hit-kills.
The following expositions of course depend on weapon type. The key is to
describe it in as vivid detail as possible.</p>
<p><strong>[On immediately attacking]</strong>: <em>You smash into the
creature with all of your might, and you hear the weapon make contact
with the creature's skull, breaking it with a crunch. Its body begins to
slump back down into the tunnel, but another seems to be pushing it
upwards. A mere second passes before another head can be seen, the one
just slayed pushed onto the mud.</em></p>
<p><strong>[On continuing to attack]</strong>: <em>Once more, a deadly
thunk is heard as the weapon aims straight for the head, gutteral voices
responding from below in a language you cannot understand and this body
slides back down into the hole, and you hear a splash from below. The
tunnel seems to be almost entirely flooded.</em></p>
<p><strong>[On continuing to attack]</strong>: <em>A third head emerges
as another desperately tries to push its way to the surface, and PLAYER,
you feel something claw onto your leg for leverage.</em></p>
<p><strong>[On pushing away the clutching claw]</strong>: <em>You wrest
your leg free as the creature slips back down into the hole. You hear
frantic shuffling from below as it tries to grab onto whatever or
whoever it can find, before you hear something heavy plunge into
water.</em>*</p>
<p><em>From behind you, you hear another noise, and as you quickly turn
your attention towards the back, you see a creature begin to emerge from
a different hole.</em></p>
<hr />
<h1 id="twist-1">Twist #1</h1>
<p>The first twist should be quite clear by now to anyone reading this.
The party is currently engaged in a slaughter of innocents, they just
don't know it yet. They are not, in fact, bloodthirsty demons, but a
local kobold population. Unless your party took precautions to prevent
such a massacre, they will have already killed a few defenceless kobolds
trying to escape death by drowning below. Make the desperation and
frenzy below as vivid as possible before the reveal. Make the party feel
powerful. Once you feel like your party has done enough damage to make
the twist sting, there are a few ways you can reveal it:</p>
<ul>
<li>A baby kobold is heard crying</li>
<li>A flash of lightning above reveals some of the dead, one being a
mother and an infant</li>
<li>A shaman speaking broken draconic pleads for mercy down below, if
you have a draconic speaker in your party</li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, the kobolds have indeed been quite a nuisance, stealing
chickens and scaring daring children throughout the years, but the
stories of bloodthirsty <em>nightcrawlers</em> are merely concoctions of
collective paranoia and urban legend.</p>
<hr />
<h1 id="twist-2">Twist #2</h1>
<p>How you continue from here depends on what your party does, but here
is where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the players, rumour of their task began to circulate
after their departure, and a dozen villagers have found some drunken
courage to assist the players, to take up their torches and pitchforks
and march off to the grove themselves.</p>
<p>At this point in the quest, it is very likely that your party will
have stopped what they are doing, realising that they have been mislead
into performing a massacre. Perhaps they have begun helping the kobolds
evacuate their flooded burrows. This is where the party begins to hear
shuffling and murmuring from behind them, finding an angry mob of locals
ready to deliver the final deathblow to their supposed terrorises,
standing by the clearing in dim torchlight. They reek of alcohol.</p>
<p>The party must now choose. Do they side with the locals and continue
the extermination? Or do they side with the kobolds, defending them?</p>
<p>No matter the choice, the consequences will be dire. If they side
with the villagers, innocent blood will be on their hands forever,
having participated in a cold-blooded massacre brought on by stupidity,
ignorance and paranoia. If they choose to side with the kobolds, the
players lose all promise of reward, and the village will consider them
cowards and weaklings, a rumour which might spread and land a serious
blow to their reputations.</p>
