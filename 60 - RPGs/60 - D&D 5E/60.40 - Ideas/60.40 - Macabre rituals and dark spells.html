spells</h1>
<h2 id="curses">Curses</h2>
<h3 id="death-curses">Death Curses</h3>
<p>A Death Curse is a special type of curse you place on a creature when
you die. Performing a Death Curse destroys your own soul in the process
but can be used to lash out in a final burst of power against a creature
that killed you. When another creature causes you to automatically die
or to take damage, and that damage reduces you to 0 hp, you can choose
to target them with your death curse if you are aware of their presence
(although you do not need to see them). If you do, choose from one of
the following effects or one that your DM approves. If you fail your
final death saving throw, your soul is burned away and the curse goes
into effect. You cannot be resurrected, even with true resurrection,
wish, or intervention from a deity. There is no known way to remove a
death curse, even with wish or assistance from a deity.</p>
<ul>
<li>When the target is brought to 0hp, it automatically fails all of its
death saves and its soul also burns away, making resurrection
impossible, even with a wish spell. Creatures without souls, or whose
souls are not contained in their bodies (like liches) are not affected
by this.</li>
<li>The target’s body becomes afflicted with a crippling curse that eats
away at it. Each year, the target’s Constitution score is reduced by 1.
When the target’s Constitution reaches 0, they die. Bringing the target
back to life requires true resurrection or wish.</li>
<li>The target’s senses betray them and they can no longer see, hear, or
smell. If they have darkvision, blindsight, blindsense, or tremorsense,
these abilities no longer work.</li>
<li>Radiant chains and manacles appear, and latch onto the creature.
Attacks against the creature always have advantage, no matter how many
sources of disadvantage would affect the attacks, and the target cannot
dash.</li>
<li>Your soul is condensed into a crystal the size of your heart, and
the targeted creature is imprisoned within it. This functions like
imprisonment except that nothing short of a wish or the express will of
a deity that is fully informed on what is contained can release the
targeted creature. This effect only works if the target's hitpoints are
less than or equal to 10x your character's level when you die.</li>
<li>Your soul flares in a wide burst of radiant energy. Creatures within
120 ft of you that are allied with the target of your death curse take
radiant damage equal to 10x your character’s level. This damage bypasses
resistance and immunity for all creatures except deities.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="deathsong">Deathsong</h3>
<p>Victims of the Deathsong curse endure agonising pain for the rest of
their short lives. They can do nothing but shriek and wail as their skin
and bones grow brittle, and eventually break and waste away.</p>
<p>To perform a Deathsong Curse, you must have an organic piece of
muscle or fatty tissue from your target, a pouch of dust of dryness, and
a vial of ground spines from a bone devil.</p>
<p>First, the dust of dryness and ground devil spines must be mixed
together in an iron bowl. Then, the target’s tissue is added to the bowl
and covered in the dust. Then the bowl must be hung over a source of
fire, and allowed to dry and cure over the course of a few weeks.</p>
<p>Once this ritual starts and every day until they either die or the
ritual is broken, the victim must make a Constitution saving throw (DC
15) or their Constitution score decreases by 1 as their body begins to
painfully wither and blacken. As the curse progresses, the skin
eventually cracks to reveal dried muscle tissue and their bones become
especially brittle. If the tissue is removed from over the fire at any
point before the victim’s Constitution score reaches 0, they are likely
to survive, but any damage to their ability score is permanent.</p>
<h3 id="melting-madness">Melting Madness</h3>
<p>This curse causes the target’s mind to begin to slip into insanity.
While their mind descends into madness, their skin also begins to sag
and droop, until it eventually sloughs off and they die.</p>
<p>Components for this ritual include a sample of tissue from the
target, such as muscle, skin, or even hair; a pint of water from the
River Styx, and a vial of whatever foul substance is secreted by a
Yochlol demon.</p>
<p>To begin the ritual, the target’s tissue sample should be submerged
in a mixture made from the water from the River Styx and the Yochlol
secretions, where it will begin to slowly dissolve.</p>
<p>The creature you target with this curse makes an Intelligence saving
throw (DC 10) or reduces their Intelligence score by 1. This save is
repeated every day until the victim’s Intelligence score is reduced to
0. When their Intelligence score reaches 5, they also gain a form of
madness (see DMG p258) and small sections of skin begin to slide off
their body. These symptoms will continue until the target’s Intelligence
reaches 0 or the sample is removed from the ritual bowl.</p>
<h2 id="dark-spells">Dark Spells</h2>
<p>The following spells have been recorded and added to the tome. While
they cannot be scribed on scrolls or into spellbooks, any prepared
spellcaster can prepare spells from this book as long as they are
attuned to it.</p>
<h3 id="circle-of-nausea">Circle of Nausea</h3>
<p>2nd-level evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60ft Components: V,
S, M (a bit of rotting flesh) Duration: Instantaneous A 20 ft radius of
sickening magic emanates from a point you can see within range.
Creatures in the area must make a Constitution saving throw or be
poisoned for 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="damning-darkness">Damning Darkness</h3>
<p>4th-level evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60ft Components: V,
S, M (bat fur, a drop of pitch, and a drop of blood) Duration:
Concentration, up to 10 minutes This spell functions as darkness except
that creatures in the area when you cast the spell take 3d6 necrotic
damage. Creatures in the area on your turn take another 3d6 necrotic
damage.</p>
<h3 id="darklight">Darklight</h3>
<p>4th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (an agate worth 10gp) Duration: 10 minutes You touch
a creature and cause it to emanate a strange, otherworldly darkness in a
radius of 10 ft. Creatures in this radius can see normally in
non-magical darkness to a range of 120ft. Areas affected by magical
darkness appear as dim light to those inside the radius. At Higher
Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
higher, the duration increases to 1 hour. If you use an 8th level spell
slot, the effect lasts for 24 hours.</p>
<h3 id="despoil">Despoil</h3>
<p>9th-level necromancy Casting Time: 24 hours Range: Touch Components:
V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 5,000 gp and a corpse
of an intelligent humanoid no more than 24 hours old, which the spell
consumes) Duration: until dispelled</p>
<p>You touch a point and infuse an area around it with unholy power. The
area can have a radius up to 1 mile, and will dispel any areas already
under the effects of a hallow spell. The affected area is then subject
to the following effects.</p>
<p>First, celestials, elementals, and fey cannot enter the area, nor can
such creatures charm, frighten, or possess creatures within it. Any
creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature is no
longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon entering the area.</p>
<p>Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect
from the following list, or choose an effect offered by the DM. When
choosing an effect, you can designate specific creatures, or a creature
type (such as fiends or humanoids) to be affected or unaffected. If a
creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first
time or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving throw. On a
success, the creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the
area</p>
<ul>
<li>Courage &amp; Fear. Evil creatures within the area are immune to the
frightened condition, and good creatures are frightened.</li>
<li>Darkness &amp; Silence. The area is filled with magical darkness.
Normal light and magical light created by anything less than a 9th level
spell cannot illuminate the area. Additionally no sound can be heard by
any creature within the spell’s area.</li>
<li>Energy Protection &amp; Vulnerability. Choose one damage type: acid,
cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. Evil creatures gain resistance to a
damage type of your choice, and good creatures that enter the space gain
vulnerability to a damage type of your choice if they are not immune or
resistant. If a good creature is resistant to the chosen damage type,
they instead suffer the normal effects of an attack. If a good creature
is immune to the chosen damage type, that immunity instead becomes
resistance.</li>
<li>Negative Energy. Non-evil creatures within the area must make a
Charisma saving throw or suffer 1d4 necrotic damage for each hour they
spend within the area. This effect still occurs every hour, even if they
make the initial save.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eye-of-the-beholder">Eye of the Beholder</h3>
<p>7th-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self
Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute For the
duration of the spell, one of your eyes grows out of your head on a
stalk, becoming like that of a beholder. When you cast the spell, and as
an action on subsequent turns, you may target a creature within 120 feet
with a ray from the eyestalk. Roll a d8 to determine what effect the ray
has.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paralysing Ray. The targeted creature makes a Constitution saving
throw or is paralysed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</li>
<li>Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a
success.</li>
<li>Slowing Ray. Target makes a Dexterity saving throw or is affected as
if by the slow spell. Target can repeat the save at the end of each of
its turn, ending it on a success.</li>
<li>Enervation Ray. Target makes a Constitution save or takes 8d8
necrotic damage, or half as much on a success.</li>
<li>Telekinetic Ray. Target makes a Strength save or can be moved 30 ft
in any direction. It is also restrained by the ray’s grip until the
start of your next turn or the spell ends.</li>
<li>Sleep Ray. Targeted creature makes a Wisdom saving throw or fall
asleep for 1 minute. This ray does not affect constructs, fey, undead,
or creatures with 50 hit points or more.</li>
<li>Disintegration Ray. Target makes a Dexterity saving throw or takes
10d8 force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 hit points, its body
becomes a pile of fine grey dust.</li>
<li>Death Ray. Targeted creatures makes a Dexterity Saving throw or
takes 10d10 necrotic damage. The target automatically dies if this ray
reduces them to 0 hp.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eyes-of-the-dead">Eyes of the Dead</h3>
<p>3rd-level divination Casting Time: 10 minutes Range: Self Components:
V, S, M (one of your own eyes and a vial of brackish water) Duration: 1
hour</p>
<p>You remove one of your own eyes from your head, and an eye from an
undead that you control, if it has one. After washing the eyes in a pint
of brackish water, you can insert your eye into your undead thrall’s
head, and your thrall’s eye into your own head. For the duration, you
can control your undead and perceive the world through it. When the
undead creature is killed or the spell ends, your eye magically returns
to you.</p>
<h3 id="false-sending">False Sending</h3>
<p>5th-level illusion Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Self Components: V,
S, M (a piece of corroded copper wire) Duration: 1 round</p>
<p>You contact a creature with whom you are familiar and send a short
message of 25 words or less per sending. The target believes the sending
came from another creature that you specify at the time of casting. You
must also be familiar with the creature you want your target to think is
responsible for the false sending. The target can respond if they
choose. The spell does not force your target to believe what is said. If
you say something that is unlikely to be said by your false sender, the
target may think they are being contacted under duress.</p>
<h3 id="fangs-of-the-vampire">Fangs of the Vampire</h3>
<p>2nd-level transmutation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a drop of vampire vitae) Duration: Concentration,
up to 1 minute</p>
<p>For the duration, you grow long fangs and can bite a creature within
5ft of you that you can see. When you cast this spell, and as an action
on subsequent turns, make a melee spell attack against the target. On a
hit, you deal 2d10 necrotic damage to the target.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
2nd.</p>
<h3 id="forbidden-speech">Forbidden Speech</h3>
<p>5th-level enchantment Casting Time: 1 minute Range: Touch Components:
V, S Duration: Permanent</p>
<p>You make it impossible for the target to speak about a certain topic
of your choosing. Topics must be specific, such as time spent in
captivity, or what they saw over the past 10 minutes. Invalid topics
include verbal spellcasting components, a creature’s life history,
etc.</p>
<p>The target makes an Intelligence saving throw or is subject to the
spell. They still remember the topic, but have no way of communicating
information about it Words become gibberish, drawings or writings are
too messy to make out, gestures are too erratic, and even thoughts are
too muddled to understand via telepathy.</p>
<p>This spell’s effects can be removed or healed with greater
restoration or similar magic.</p>
<p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th
level or higher, its effects can only be removed if greater restoration
or similar magic is cast at the same level or higher.</p>
<h3 id="imprison-possessor">Imprison Possessor</h3>
<p>5th-level abjuration Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30ft Components:
V, S Duration: Until dispelled</p>
<p>You trap a creature that can possess or inhabit another creature, or
one that can move its mind out of its body, within the creature it is
currently inhabiting. As long as the spell is in effect, the target is
trapped in its current body and cannot leave it by any means.</p>
<h3 id="pestilence">Pestilence</h3>
<p>8th-level necromancy Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components:
V, S, M (a sample of diseased tissue) Duration: Instantaneous</p>
<p>You touch a creature and attempt to infect them with a disease. The
creature makes a Constitution saving throw or contracts whatever illness
your sample contains. The target suffers none of the disease effects,
but becomes contagious to others after 24 hours.</p>
<h3 id="power-leech">Power Leech</h3>
<p>7th-level necromancy Casting Time: 1 action Range: 60 ft Components:
V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>
<p>You create a conduit of energy between you and a target in range.
Each round, you choose an ability. The target makes a saving throw for
that ability or that score decreases by 1 for the them and increases by
1 for you. This spell ends if you or the target end your turns more than
60 ft away from each other. The target makes saves at disadvantage if
you are within 30 ft of each other. Any ability score changes last for
up to one hour and then return to normal.</p>
<h2 id="fiendish-truenames">Fiendish Truenames</h2>
<p>Names written in this section appear to be compiled by at least a
dozen different people. Some of the names are written in clear and neat
handwriting, others in hastily made chicken scratch. Some are marked out
and most others have been completely blotted out with an impossibly dark
ink stain. Some are listed with information or commentary from previous
authors, and others are listed with no notes at all. All the names are
written in Dark Speech, and speaking one of these names aloud will cause
psychic damage per the normal rules for Dark Speech.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ali’mannd</li>
<li>Brizzgon</li>
<li>Kahaar (This name is almost marked out enough that you cannot
decipher it.)</li>
<li>Tolgath</li>
<li>Xargrag - DANGEROUS - in huge, blocky letters, is written in the
margin next to this name. It is underlined several times.</li>
<li>Xorgruzal - The phrase “Information is pricey, but reliable. Use a
Circle.” is scrawled in a small, messy hand.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lichdom">Lichdom</h2>
<p>A long and exceedingly complicated process of how to achieve lichdom
is described in painstaking detail with pages and pages of diagrams and
arcane sigils. The instructions are jumbled, and there are many notes in
the corner that reference secrets and advice acquired from powerful
beings. The only three entities referred to by name are called Vecna,
Acererak, and Orcus. There is also mention of a Council and a warning
that they should not be sought out for information on this topic. While
the actual process is not in any sensical order, it could be organized
into the following sections.</p>
<h3 id="the-phylactery">The Phylactery</h3>
<p>All of the paths to lichdom require a phylactery to store the soul
and prevent it from returning to The Weave. The theories presented in
the book describe several different opinions on what makes the best
phylactery, but the basics are as follows.</p>
<h4 id="a-container">A Container</h4>
<p>The Phylactery requires a series of complex arcane symbols and lines
be created on the interior of the container. There is no apparent issue
with sealing or locking it once your soul is contained within, but it
also must be able to open and close before your spirit is stored inside.
Because of this, a solid object cannot be used as a phylactery. Each
aspiring lich must also create their own phylactery that is unique to
them. Attempting to use a phylactery made by anyone else will fail to
house the soul properly and ruin the ritual.</p>
<h4 id="sizing-requirements">Sizing Requirements</h4>
<p>The authors of the Book of Vile Darkness seem to think that any
volume is theoretically possible, even down to a fine grain of sand, but
the practical aspects of adding the requisite arcane marks on such a
small surface pose a problem. The smallest recommended size is about the
size of a ring box.</p>
<h4 id="expensive-components">Expensive Components</h4>
<p>Although there is no indication that the base material a phylactery
is made from has any larger influence on the core magic, durable and
expensive materials seem to be better suited for such a long-term task.
Iron or Adamantine, for example make the phylactery physically harder to
destroy. Additionally, the runes on the interior must be carved out and
then filled with a pure silver. The purification of the silver is
laborious and requires magical components that cost at least 10,000 gp
alone.</p>
<h3 id="the-rituals">The Rituals</h3>
<p>Once the phylactery is complete, the ritual can be performed. This
long and intricate process must be done with care, and everyone involved
must be wholly dedicated to completing it, with the exception of any
unwilling sacrifices.</p>
<h4 id="the-supplies">The Supplies</h4>
<p>In addition to the phylactery, someone that undergoes this ritual
will need 10 barrels of water from the River Styx, five additional
allied spellcasters to help manage and focus the energy properly, and a
20th-level spellcaster to lead and perform the process.</p>
<h4 id="the-offerings">The Offerings</h4>
<p>Ascension to lichdom requires the sacrifice of several spellcasters.
In total, the ritual requires sacrificing at least ten 9th-level (or
higher) spellcasters that do not include the creature seeking to become
a lich. If the sacrifices are genuinely willing to die in this endeavor,
the number needed is halved.</p>
<h4 id="the-site">The Site</h4>
<p>The location for this ritual must be under the effects of a despoil
spell or a 9th-level hallow spell that has been specifically perverted
to create undead instead of prevent them. Several of the arcane symbols
included in the section must be dug or cut into stone ground for the
sacrificial blood to form the symbols needed, and an outer ring that
forms a shallow moat around the entire site must be dug and filled with
the water from the Styx.</p>
<h4 id="the-final-process">The Final Process</h4>
<p>The person who will be turning into the lich must go to each
sacrifice and kill them individually using a Karras Stone Knife (see the
Macabre Rituals section below) while the leader recites the incantation.
As the sacrificial blood fills the arcane circles, the person seeking
lichdom must take their own life with the Karras Knife and attempt an
Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 30). On a success, the ritual will
capture and store the person’s soul in the phylactery and they will rise
as a lich. On a failure, the target simply dies and the ritual fails. If
enemies infiltrate the ritual and are not detected, the Arcana check is
made with disadvantage.</p>
<h2 id="macabre-rituals">Macabre Rituals</h2>
<p>Some of the rituals included rely on the metaphysical concept of
thaumaturgy, which is not the same as the common parlour trick magics
performed by many clerics (although such tricks rely on similar theory).
This kind of thaumaturgy refers to a concept of “As above, so below.” If
you can make something happen on a small scale, you can cause it to
happen on a larger scale. Additionally, all of the ritual incantations
included here must be spoken aloud in Dark Speech, and will incur the
normal psychic damage associated.</p>
<h3 id="green-fog">Green Fog</h3>
<p>Dense clouds of greenish mist roll across wide swaths of land. Any
living creature that touches the mist is polymorphed into a random
beast. This fog usually covers an area of 1-4 miles across and lasts for
up to 10 minutes at any given time. The ritual that creates a Green Fog
is fairly simple, and its ingredient list is short and also
flexible.</p>
<p>At its core, this ritual relies on a large iron cauldron that is
filled with the blood of shapechangers and a small model of the area to
be affected. When placed over a fire and the blood is brought to a boil,
notable bits of local fauna are dropped in and stirred while the
incantation is recited. Using bird wings, rabbit feet or ears, or deer
antlers are common, but any beast should work. After an hour of stirring
and incantations, a thin green mist should form and the final
incantation should be performed and the model submerged in the mixture.
The fog will form at the edge of the area closest to where the ritual is
being performed and will move across the region until it reaches the
other edge and dissipates. It will flow into buildings if windows and
doors are not sealed tightly, but it does not ascend stairs or ramps.
Any creatures that are touched by the mist will be subjected to its
effects, which last until dispelled. Creatures with the shapechanger tag
are immune to these effects.</p>
<p>If the blood used is more than 48 hours old, whoever is performing
the ritual must make an Intelligence (arcana) check (DC 15). If the
ritual is performed under a full moon, this check is made with
advantage.</p>
<h3 id="karras-stone-knife">Karras Stone Knife</h3>
<p>Usually used in sacrificial rituals, a Karras Stone Knife leaves
ragged cuts, causing a creature that takes damage from one to take
additional damage at the start of their turn. Additionally, if a Karras
knife is used to harvest flesh for a curse, the target makes any
curse-related saving throws with disadvantage. These knives are carved
from a Karras Stone, from which they get their name, which can be
acquired through a dark ritual.</p>
<p>Completing this ritual requires sacrificing an intelligent creature
during the a lunar eclipse. The day prior, the sacrifice must eat a
large meal of fatty foods like bacon, ham, or foods that use a lot of
butter or other fats. The actual ritual must take place outdoors and
under the open sky, and includes an incantation that must be started at
the beginning of the totality. Begin by wrapping a small pebble with a
stomach lining from a sheep, pig, or other domesticated livestock beast
and holding it above the abdomen of the sacrifice as the incantation is
spoken. The sacrifice must be slain in the final moments of totality by
stabbing into the victim’s stomach. After the ritual has completed, the
Karras Stone can be cut free from the sacrifice’s gallbladder and then
honed into a knife used for curses.</p>
<h3 id="rain-of-blood">Rain of Blood</h3>
<p>Rolling in like a normal thunderstorm, this macabre weather system’s
heavy rains turn to blood, covering the area in a thick, dark, sticky
red mess. Any living, non-evil creature must make a Wisdom saving throw
or be frightened for 24 hours. The DC of this effect begins at 10, but
can be increased depending on the quality of materials used.</p>
<p>This ritual requires a small model of the target area to be crafted.
The model does not have to be exceedingly accurate, but for every full
day spent crafting the model, the ritual’s save DC increases by +1 to a
maximum of +5. Additionally, the process requires a small amount of
blood. Generally the ritual caster will use their own blood, but the
blood of a fiendish creature increases the DC by a number equal to that
creature’s challenge to a maximum of +5.</p>
<p>Performing the actual ritual is fairly straightforward. A short
incantation is recited while water is poured over the model and then,
while the model is still wet, the blood must be dripped over it. If
successful, a rain shower will blow across the location the next day and
suddenly shift to rain blood for 1d10 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="third-eye">Third Eye</h3>
<p>This ritual involves a willing target to undergo a physical
disfiguration to plant a petrified eye into their forehead. Depending on
the ritual used, this third eye can allow the target to see invisible
creatures, into the ethereal plane for 1 minute per day, or some other
similar effect.</p>
<p>The core of this ritual relies on the type of eye used. Harvesting an
eye from a creature that can see invisibility grants that power.
Likewise, many creatures have blindsight, true seeing, or can peer into
the minds of other creature around them. Only one effect can be granted
from this ritual though, so if a creature has multiple abilities that
could be used, you must choose which one to gain.</p>
<p>The process requires assistance from at least one other person and
the use of a Karras Stone Knife. Whoever is gaining the Third eye must
be restrained on a table that has a ritual circle carved into it around
their head. Care can also be taken to immobilize the head to minimize
damage, but this is not required. As the incantation is recited, the
forehead must be cut open deeply enough to create a groove in the bone
of the skull. The harvested Eye is then placed over the wound until the
incantation is completed. Creatures that undergo this process gain 4
levels of exhaustion until they complete a long rest and disadvantage on
sight-based perception checks for 5 days while they get used to the new
eye.</p>
<h3 id="violet-storm">Violet Storm</h3>
<p>A Violet Storm is made of deep purple and blue clouds that block out
light from the sun almost entirely. Red flashes of lightning flicker
across the sky and to the ground. During the storm, magic items don’t
function and any spellcasters must make spellcasting ability check (DC
15). On a failure, they cannot regain spell slots during a long or short
rest for 24 hours. A Violet Storm will usually last for 2d6 days, and
spellcasters must attempt to make the saving throw each day in order to
to cast spells.</p>
<p>This ritual has several aspects that usually require different skill
sets, and so it is often performed with a group. A character that wants
to aid another in part of the ritual or its preparation must have the
requisite proficiencies to perform the given task.</p>
<p>Like most rituals that affect a geographic area, a model of the
region is needed. For this specific ritual, the model must be
particularly finely crafted from silver or gold and worth at least
10,000gp per square mile to be affected. A creature that is proficient
in smith’s tools or jeweler’s tools can craft the item over the course
of a week for half the cost with a Dexterity check (DC 20).</p>
<p>Aside from the model, a medium sized iron cauldron must be at least
half-filled with blood or viscera from creatures that have spell
resistance and a challenge rating of 10 or more. The text recommends
acquiring such materials from fiends that have been sentenced to
punishment for whatever transgressions they committed against their
superiors, but mentions that many fey creatures also are resistant to
magic and could be an option.</p>
<p>The rest of the process is fundamentally straightforward, but does
require some nuance. Different ingredients reach different stages at
different times, so knowing when to change the direction of stirring and
when to cover the model in the liquid requires an Intelligence (Arcana)
check (DC 20). After submerging the model in the liquid or pouring the
liquid over the model (for particularly large areas), whoever is
conducting the incantation must make a Charisma (Performance) check (DC
20). If the ritual is successful, the liquid will burn off the model and
leave a thick purple grime behind. The following day, a Violet Storm
will cover the area for 2d6 days.</p>
<h2 id="poison-recipes">Poison Recipes</h2>
<p>The poisons described below can generally be administered in any way
a person wants - either inhalation, ingestion, or directly into the
bloodstream through a physical weapon attack. The book emphasizes the
most common ways of administering these toxins, which tend to be the
most effective way as well, but most of them can still be utilised
through other methods as well.</p>
<h3 id="agony">Agony</h3>
<p>Anything that would normally be painful to the target is interpreted
by their mind as something that feels pleasurable instead. Any attacks
rolled against someone who is poisoned with Agony are made with
advantage.</p>
<p>This poison is made from a type of plant with razor-sharp leaves that
grows only in the acidic environment of Minauros, the third circle of
Hell or any acrid environments within the Abyss. It can be ground into a
paste, brewed into a tea, or dried and crushed into a powder. Generally,
Agony is ingested through the poisoning of food or drink. It takes
approximately 1 hour to metabolise, after which the victim makes a DC 20
Constitution saving throw or is subject to the effects.</p>
<h3 id="devilweed">Devilweed</h3>
<p>Devilweed is a plant that looks like a dark brown or reddish grass
that always grows on rocks. However, the rocky base is part of the
plant. When disturbed, the leaves retract into the rock. Unless someone
is particularly stealthy, this plant is usually harvested by waiting
nearby for the leaves to emerge from the stone after being
disturbed.</p>
<p>If added to any potion, Devilweed corrupts the liquid. The original
effects will still function normally, but the victim must make a DC 15
Constitution save or become exceedingly paranoid for the next 24 hours.
Extended exposure to Devilweed can result in a permanent paranoia or
other forms of madness.</p>
<h3 id="feather-powder">Feather Powder</h3>
<p>Designed specifically to target celestial creatures, this fine red
powder sticks remarkably well to feathers. This powder is made from a
mixture of volcanic rock, dried burs, and dirt from an unhallowed or
evil place. When mixed together and dried, the final product should be a
reddish colour, although anything from a bright crimson to a muddy rust
colour will work.</p>
<p>If a vial is thrown and hits a celestial creature with wings, it
deals 2d4 necrotic damage each round. The target can use an action to
attempt a DC 15 Dexterity check to shake the dust out of their wings and
end the effect. If the dust was made using Dust of Sneezing and Choking,
the check is made with disadvantage.</p>
<h3 id="fire-venom">Fire Venom</h3>
<p>The target’s skin reddens and their insides seem to burn for 4-5
days. During the worst of this, the victim vomits red and orange bile,
but it’s rarely lethal. Crafting Fire Venom isn’t difficult, but the
ingredients can be hard to come by. It requires a special species of
white flower that only grows in frigid arctic areas. The plant is
difficult to find, but easy to identify by its bright white petals that
are speckled with tiny reddish dots.</p>
<p>To craft this poison, the entire flower, stems and leaves included,
must be steeped in icy water for 48 hours until it begins to fall apart.
After this, remove the flower pieces and grind them into a paste. This
paste can be stored in a vial until it is ready to be used.</p>
<h3 id="lightning-toxin">Lightning Toxin</h3>
<p>A target’s blood vessels expand and swell and create a lightning
pattern across the skin. The toxin will eventually cause the victim’s
veins to burst and they will bleed to death.</p>
<p>Brewing this toxin requires some rare ingredients, including a
spoonful of magnetised iron filings and the ground scales of a blue or
bronze dragon. When the metal dust and ground scales are mixed together
in a ceramic bowl and melted over a fire, they will combine to form
Lightning Toxin. When cooled, the toxin is solid but can be easily cut
with a knife or grated into flakes.</p>
<p>This toxin is only effective if ingested, and after 6-8 hours, the
victim will develop the physical symptoms. After 24 hours, they must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 20) or die from blood loss.
If they succeed, they will eventually recover, but their skin will still
bear distinct lightning-shaped scars.</p>
<h3 id="moradyne-vapors-dreammist">Moradyne Vapors (Dreammist)</h3>
<p>Moradyne is a large fern that grows in temperate and tropical
forests. It can only be found in the most remote areas of such places,
and is generally avoided because of the painful stinging trichomes that
grow on its surface. However, if it is collected and the hairs removed,
the plant can be brewed into a tea. If the vapours from Moradyne Tea are
inhaled or ingested, a victim falls unconscious for 1d3 hours, during
which time they experience vivid and beautiful dreams.</p>
<h3 id="petrani">Petrani</h3>
<p>Another lethal poison, Petrani is made from fairly mundane
ingredients, but requires special equipment to mix properly. It calls
for a delicate mixture of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary stones
(the text recommends granite, marble, and coal, although any stones of
those types will work).</p>
<p>The stones must be ground and blended together and then melted under
very high levels of heat for a full 24 hours. The level of heat required
is more than wood or coal forges are capable of, and the text recommends
using forges in Phlegethos, the fourth circle of Hell. After this point,
it should be allowed to cool, and then it can be easily broken apart
into a fine dust that can dissolve into most liquids.</p>
<p>If ingested, the target gains +1 to their AC as their skin grows
thicker. Each day after this, the target loses one point of Dexterity,
5ft of movement, and gains another point of AC. When their dex reaches
zero, they begin to suffocate and die. Making a successful Constitution
save (DC 20) can delay the effect for one day, but there is no known
cure for the poison.</p>
<h3 id="terran-brandy">Terran Brandy</h3>
<p>Made from the glittering dust harvested from a dying fey creature and
distilling it into a potent alcohol with normal distillation methods. If
prepared correctly, this can bolster spellcasting by increasing the save
DC of any enchantment spells by +1, but it is usually used for its
ability to cause hallucinations. When dosed properly, a person that
drinks Terran Brandy sees beautiful and enchanting visions of alluring
fey creatures in place of real people and creatures. Additional notes in
the text suggest using this as a method to lure people away from crowded
areas.</p>
<h3 id="vampirism">Vampirism</h3>
<p>Most people that become vampires do so by starting as a thrall to
another vampire and serving them until finding a chance to escape or
kill their sire. But the pages in this book speak of another way to
become a vampire - a path that that requires no servitude to anyone
else.</p>
<p>This ritual can only be performed under a total solar eclipse, and
must be completed at the first moments of totality so that the
transformation completes before the eclipse ends. Just like the ritual
path to lichdom, this preparation involves a hallow spell that has been
inverted to bolster the strength of undead instead of preventing their
creation and the killing of ten living sacrifices. It also requires the
use of an iron cup with specific necromantic sigils engraved on its
surface. As the eclipse begins, but before the totality, the would-be
vampire must kill each of the sacrifices while reciting the incantation
and letting their victims' blood soak into the ground. As each sacrifice
dies, the ritual cup must be filled with the last of their life blood,
which must be ingested by the ritualist.</p>
<p>As the moment of totality nears, the person attempting to transform
into a vampire must cut into their own throat and fill the cup with
their own blood. As the totality begins, they must drink from the cup,
and let the rest of their blood soak into the ground. Before they die,
they make an Intelligence (Aracana) check (DC 20). This check is made
with advantage if a Karras Stone Knife is used. On a success, they will
rise as a vampire at the peak of the eclipse, but they must find a
shelter before the totality ends to avoid burning in the sun.</p>
<h2 id="killing-a-god">Killing a God</h2>
<p>There is only one page that mentions anything in line with this - and
only about a third of it still exists within the book - the other pages
seem to be torn out. Out of the remaining legible text, it seems that
someone has attempted to record a process to kill or destroy a deity.
The tiny bits that you can make out reference a shard, something about
enemies being more powerful than neutral gods, and several notations of
how dangerous the process is.</p>
