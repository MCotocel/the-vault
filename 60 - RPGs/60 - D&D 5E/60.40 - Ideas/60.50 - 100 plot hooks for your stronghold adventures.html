use tricks and illusion to make their opponent look ridicolous in front

who, but someone in the stronghold. The locals itch for a good burning,
in any case.</td>

scammed some wealthy merchants to get it. They didn’t appreciate it and
caught up before he could get away. He asks the players to hide him and
his “technically not stolen” wares in their stronghold. Legally, he
didn’t quite break the law, so…</td>

instead? A lot of people will be really unhappy if the mutant stays
around, but he did nothing wrong.</td>

it, they were an asshole, unpleasant and downright violent. But they’re
still a servant of the players. To insult them is to insult the players.
Letting this go without punishing the witch will surely damage their
reputation, and make people question their loyalty:" What good is
serving them if they won’t even protect me?"</td>

stronghold.</td>

stronghold. A servant probably did it, many seem to know about it, but
nobody wants to talk. What for? The victim was a nobody, and nobody will
ever know. Surely you’re not proposing to punish a faithful servant just
for that? Let it go.</td>

want to open a thieves guild hidden in/next to the stronghold. The
players will get special access to the black market, discounts,
information and the guarantee they won’t be targets of the guild, in
exchange for protection and discretion.</td>

together with a bunch of monks. They’re clearly dedicated and will bring
blessings and protection from the agents of evil. They’re also nuts and
may start witch hunts and oppress the locals. Refusing will bring their
hammer, and, they say, the anger of the gods.</td>

alchemist is talented, no doubt, and they offer the players some really
neat potions. They’re also a bit unstable, and their experiments often
get right on the verge of going out of control. No problem, the
alchemist guarantees. All cool. Just don’t ask about the previous
laboratory.</td>

other nobles.</td>

players money and useful companions, but the merchant handles the
animals with awful and violent methods. Still, technically it’s not
illegal, and if the players find out only after the menagerie has been
built, it won’t be easy to remove it without paying a hefty fine and
causing a scandal. Not legally, at least.</td>

real handful: annoying, pretentious and overbearing, but aren’t all
great artists? Their talent is clear, the populace loves them and nobles
love to be seen by others at their spectacles.</td>

to make the peasants happy and entertain the kids. All very humble. Too
humble, other nobles will surely dislike something like this. What a

town.</td>

Gold. Gold. Ethics? Eh, whatever. Think of the gold.</td>

they are tired, the season is hard, food is scarce. The players can
refuse an important upgrade/addition to the stronghold to make the
peasants happy, but damage their reputation with other nobles, or work
their peasants to the bone and gain a reputation as brutal
dictators.</td>

are about to declare their independence, break off from the kingdom.
Sure, they wouldn’t have to pay any more taxes, there is potentially
much to gain, but the backlash would be enormous. The players can squash
these rumours, hopefully before they reach the ears of the king. Unless
they want to consider the idea…</td>

They don’t want to follow the players anymore, and a few rebels seem

with violence, try to gain back their trust, or hey, maybe they will
accept and leave.</td>

<td>A retired professor has a proposal: open a school for the local
peasants. Teach them the basics, at least reading and some maths and
history. Sounds nice, right? WRONG! Other nobles find the idea absurd,
and will not tolerate something like that. It’s a mockery of everything
their society is based on, an attack at their status. Even the king is
getting involved. The players will get in real troubles if they go
through with this idea.</td>

welcomed the way he deserves: massive celebrations, plenty of food,
games, music. The celebration alone will keep the players busy for days,
not to mention the time it will take to prepare it, and the enormous
waste of resources, food, and the time it will take from the peasants
that could have other things to do. Refusing, while tempting, would
carry heavy repercussions and the anger of the noble.</td>

Legally, there isn’t much they can do to stop them, but the bard often
goes past simple humour, and seems to be actively harming their
reputation. Maybe the bard secretly works for somebody?</td>

the land. They are talented, and they would surely make the nearby lands

almost everybody has forgotten. It’s not an evil deity, but its cult is

surely bring boons and blessings, but also the ire of the king.</td>
