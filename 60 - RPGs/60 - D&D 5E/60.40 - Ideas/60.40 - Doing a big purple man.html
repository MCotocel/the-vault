<h1 id="doing-a-big-purple-man">Doing a big purple man</h1>
<h2 id="making-your-villain-seem-like-they-have-a-point">Making Your
Villain Seem Like They Have a Point</h2>
<p>Curious choice of words, isn't it? "Seem like" they have a point. Let
me explain.</p>
<p>The Big Purple Man, of course, is Thanos. Back in 2018, two thousand
years ago, Thanos presented hundreds of millions of people with what
seemed to be a good argument in favor of killing off half the population
of the universe.</p>
<p>Thanos argued that overpopulation of sentient beings would eventually
result in universal societal collapse, since there would be too many
mouths to feed and not enough to go around. By cutting the population in
half arbitrarily, he could stave off this coming doom.</p>
<p>Thanos, of course, was wrong. He wasn't just wrong, he was obviously
wrong. The argument he presented was most famously made by the human
economist Thomas Malthus, who proposed the cutting of programs designed
to help the poor in order to stave off national starvation in the
future. Malthusian thinking has been debunked over and over again by
economists, scientific studies, and political figures as a
short-sighted, selfish measure, and it was just as epic a pwnage the
thirtieth time as the first. Thanos' own take on the philosophy would
have presumably forced him to cull the population over and over in order
to maintain prosperity.</p>
<p>And of course, there's the problem that for a guy who claims to want
a peaceful death for half the universe, he sure does like torturing and
killing people.</p>
<p>But that didn't matter, because Infinity War's Thanos was a buff,
beautiful man with a glorious scrotum chin and the sonorous voice of
Josh Brolin. He expressed his abominable views with poise and grace, and
there was something deeply moving about the way his digitally-rendered
lips parted in horror when he callously threw his "favorite daughter"
off a cliff to get the Soul Stone.</p>
<p>What can we learn here? Well, besides that, two thousand years later
in 2020, there are still a troubling number of people who will defend
anything Josh Brolin narrates if his shoulders are muscly enough, there
are several techniques we can draw on to make our villains force our
players to question their own motives.</p>
<h3 id="beauty-is-important">Beauty is important</h3>
<p>As long as a villain is hideous to behold, it's hard to take their
ideas seriously, no matter what their actual beliefs are. On the other
hand, if you put a big beautiful man in front of your audience, they're
more likely to believe what they're saying is true.</p>
<h3 id="framing-is-important">Framing is important</h3>
<p>Thanos wanted to kill probably trillions of trillions of people, but
by framing it as "saving everyone else," he was able to look more
convincing. Make sure your villain's motives are framed positively.
Instead of raising an army of undead, your necromancer is creating an
indestructible workforce that can serve the people.</p>
<h3 id="monologues-are-important">Monologues are important</h3>
<p>If your villain doesn't get to deploy their attitudes for the players
to learn, they have no opportunity to be swayed to their side. Trap
their characters, give the villain time to talk to them.</p>
<h3 id="go-read-your-philosophy-textbooks">Go read your philosophy
textbooks</h3>
<p>And brush up on rhetoric, too! You're going to need to defend the
indefensible. Even if it's just the SparkNotes, that puts you miles
ahead of 99.9% of players in terms of ideological preparation.</p>
<h2 id="lets-make-a-big-purple-man">Let's Make a Big Purple Man</h2>
<p>So for this example, I'm going to take an obviously evil motive and
villain and make them at least <em>potentially</em> compelling. Dark Sun
is great for this!</p>
<p>The chief villains of Dark Sun are the Sorcerer-Kings, ancient and
mighty wizards whose magic literally kills the planet a little more
every time they use it. It's even implied to be killing the <em>star
Athas orbits around</em> - it used to be blue, but in the span of a few
dozen millennia, it's faded to yellow and then red. In return for
destroying the environment, the Sorcerer-Kings are slowly transforming
into the only dragons on the planet, becoming apex predators that are
akin to gods.</p>
<p>That's right, we're going to make <em>continuing climate change</em>
seem like a reasonable position. Or at least, we're going to try.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of Sorcerer-Kings, and most of them are pretty
ugly. They're all partially through the stages of draconic
transformation, which doesn't look pretty at any stage unless you're
into that, so only their polymorphed forms and illusions can be relied
upon.</p>
<p>The odd thing to consider is that a woman <em>cannot</em> be the
Villain With Good Points, especially not when they're doing the kind of
things you do in Dark Sun. This isn't some weird ideological point on my
part, the trope of the Evil Queen is an extremely common one that's hard
to break due to the associated trope of the Evil Enchantress/Seductress.
Of course, you can try to make it work, but it doesn't have a better
chance of success.</p>
<p>So let's go with Hamanu, the Lion King and the closest thing Dark Sun
has to a Thanos figure. Hamanu's illusory form is a big, beautiful man
with the head of a lion. It fits the beauty requirement. Lions, of
course, have a large amount of symbolism in Western society,
representing just rulership and nobility. If you can get Liam Neeson to
voice him, you can convince the one Christian member of your group that
much better!</p>
<p>(Narnia references, aren't they great?)</p>
<p>Hamanu has a reputation as a just, rational, and incredibly cruel
ruler. His name and laws are based off those of Hammurabi. This is very
similar to Thanos: the cruelty is more abstracted, and any individual
actions can be brushed off, because everything Hamanu does, other
Sorcerer-Kings do, and then some.</p>
<p>Hamanu's final goal is becoming a dragon. He can only do this because
he is a) both a wizard and a psionicist, and b) a human. Only humans can
become dragons in Dark Sun, which was a source of racially-motivated
genocidal action by the Sorcerer-Kings in the past age of the world.</p>
<p>This is sort of a difficult thing to make good, so let's run with
that "only X person with X skills can become this" idea. That's a very
individualistic goal, so let's attach some individualistic philosophy to
that.</p>
<p>Of course, Hamanu wasn't really responsible for his own ascension.
Dregoth, the most powerful Sorcerer-King, got a little too big for his
britches, so the other Kings quickly roped Hamanu into their scheme and
did a drive-by on Dregoth and his whole city. But the players don't need
to hear that! That's consistent with people espousing that kind of
individualistic philosophy too, so if they do figure it out, it means
your game has even more Big Themes than Dark Sun has normally!</p>
<p>When Hamanu is confronted by the players over his goals, or he's
captured them and takes the time to monologue, he should say something
along these lines:</p>
<p><em>"Do you know how one becomes a dragon? Only the most powerful of
wizards, the most devout seekers of the Way, can attain such a grand
height of power. And here I am, on the cusp of that grand
ascension.</em></p>
<p><em>"I did it! With the sweat of my brow and the blood in my veins, I
seized the reins of power! For a thousand years I have crawled up the
hill whose summit is granted only to the strongest.</em></p>
<p><em>"I stand as a monument to the power and potential of all of
humankind. What I have done, what I have achieved, is open to all
humans. Through the power of my mind and body I have become akin to a
god, and if I succeed, I can guide all people to godhood!</em></p>
<p><em>"Of course some would fail. I cannot control the minds of all
people. Many simply lack the mental fortitude to achieve this kind of
power. This deeply saddens me, but it is their own decision to forego
this path, and I do not begrudge them this decision.</em></p>
<p><em>"But I do not believe that I should be held down by the bad
decisions of others. I believe that I should be a river to my people, to
lead them to the right path.</em></p>
<p><em>"Do not do this. Do not fight back against the destiny of
humankind. Leave your doomed quest, and I will forgive you."</em></p>
<p>I'm sure Liam Neeson has a Cameo account, so I could probably get him
to read this.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>What can we learn from the Big Purple Man? Simple: How to make our
villains seem like they have a point, even though they clearly don't.
Not only can you persuade your players to maybe even take their side,
you will definitely make your world seem more fleshed out and your
characters more realized by giving them "realistic" explanations for
their actions.</p>
