<h1 id="why-to-ban-the-phrase-hit-points">Why to ban the phrase 'hit
points'</h1>
<p>Many phrases have found themselves in 5th Edition D&amp;D primarily
because of tradition, and 'Hit Points' is perhaps the most consistent of
these. Methods for calculating defences come and go (THAC0, anyone?) but
Hit Points have remained. Recently, however, as I have been tinkering
with various things in the combat system of 5e, I have decided to try
changing the terminology for Hit Points. That's right - I've changed
next to nothing about the mechanics of Hit Points, just what they are
called. You may think this is nit-picking and irrelevant - who cares
what the term is as long as the maths works out? - but I hope today to
change your mind.</p>
<p>I would argue that the terms we DMs use to describe mechanical
elements of a player character, NPC or creature (Hit Points, Sleight of
Hand, Armour Class, whatever) is the single most important way of
controlling how your players interact with your fantasy world. Players
can imagine their characters all they like at home on their sofa, but it
is the mechanics of the game - and the language of those mechanics -
which connect them to the game world and gives them legitimacy at our
tables. So whether those numbers that denote how much your character is
alive are called 'Hit Points' or something else is, I believe, a key
issue every DM needs to consider.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-wrong-with-hit-points">So what's wrong with Hit
Points?</h2>
<p>As most of you know, D&amp;D evolved out of wargames. 'Hit Points' is
a great phrase to denote the amount of literal 'hits' your army,
vehicle, ship, or whatever has sustained. A warship can take a number of
hits from enemy warships, and then it sinks. Perfect. Once we scale this
to the individual level, though, things get a little weird. Here are a
few issues I see with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players being physically hit - a lot. Are your 'Hit Points' as a
player character the number of times you are actually hit? Does a Level
10 fighter on 1 Hit Point look like a pin cushion with twenty arrows
sticking out of him? Obviously that would be ridiculous, so as DMs we
are often struggling to find other ways to narrative how a player's Hit
Points could be depleted without them being hit. There is a discrepancy
between the terminology and what we describe here, which can lead to us
all having to do some mental gymnastics, which isn't always great for
immersion.</li>
<li>Unusual damage types. I also find it strange to consider how
something like psychic damage can affect one's Hit Points. Are we
imagining here that the victim is suffering actual brain damage? How
does that work? They are surely not being 'hit' by anything,
really.</li>
<li>Dropping to zero. Because the phrase 'Hit Points' implies physical
damage more than anything else, it is my belief that this is one of the
main things which contributes to this 'kill or be killed' mentality,
where every fight continues until one side or the other are all at zero
Hit Points, which can only mean death or unconsciousness, rarely
surrender or flight.</li>
</ul>
<p>One easy solution to this is to shrug your shoulders and say, "It's
always been called Hit Points, I don't really care what it's called,
I'll just describe things differently so that it makes sense." If that
is acceptable to you, more power to you. The rest of this post isn't for
you, sadly - but it is for any other DMs who, like me, find this phrase
bothersome and don't mind doing a bit of work to change it.</p>
<p>So what should we replace it with?</p>
<p>Let me walk you through my thought process on this and you can make
up your own mind afterwards.</p>
<p>Firstly, we might look to something like Dark Souls which makes good
use of 'Stamina'. Stamina still holds that sense of physicality that Hit
Points does, but it can more easily incorporate 'damage' that occurs
even when you block, jump out the way, etc. However, it still doesn't
address our issue with unusual damage types such as psychic, so perhaps
not the best choice.</p>
<p>Moving on, we could widen the scope to something more like 'Morale'.
With morale we can easily narrative why psychic damage hurts you -
because it damages your 'will to fight' - and we are more likely, when
hitting zero Morale, to be inclined to describe an enemy surrendering or
fleeing, which could open up greater roleplay opportunities for your
players. However, a new issue introduces itself here: how do you deal
with creatures like undead skeletons controlled by the Lich Lord
Supreme? Or constructs that only carry out their initial orders? They
surely have no 'morale' or 'will to fight' that could be damaged. We
don't want multiple terms for different creatures, so Morale perhaps
doesn't fit the bill either.</p>
<p>Finally, then, we come to the term which I am replacing 'Hit Points'
with in my game: composure.</p>
<h2 id="composure">Composure</h2>
<p>Any Sekiro fans will see some inspiration here. I think the best way
to explain this idea is simply to show you the write up I sent to my
players about it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The term 'Hit Points' is replaced with 'Composure'.</p></li>
<li><p>Composure is a measure of your physical ability and mental
willpower to continue an activity, be that engaging in battle, climbing
a mountainside or weathering a heavy storm. Attacks and effects that
deal damage will subtract this from your total Composure. You calculate
your total Composure in the same way you would Hit Points, and you can
gain temporary Composure in the same way you would gain temporary Hit
Points. Once you reach 0 Composure, you have become too tired to
continue, either physically, mentally, or a combination of both.
Depending on the situation, you may fall unconscious or become
incapacitated in some other way.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You may rightly say that this change seems barely worthy of a BTS
post (it's only changing a term, after all), but there is honestly such
a shift in how I, as the DM, and my players interact with the game world
when we start using this word. Fights become about finding that
particular element of a creature that the players can use to damage its
composure, be that the warlord's arrogance, the owlbear's fight/flight
response, or simply the skeletons physical composition. Games take on a
naturally more tactical nature, in my experience.</p>
<p>Once this is in place I also realised it was quite easy to
re-introduce a mechanic from 4th edition which I was sad to see go in
5th: the bloodied condition. However, it's not just copied verbatim
here, but worked into the idea of composure. Here's what I sent my
players about it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a creature falls below half their total Composure, their
Composure is considered 'broken'. For player characters this has no
especial effect, although you as a player may wish to use this
mechanical element to give flavour to how your character is reacting to
a given situation; for instance, if the dragon's breath weapon takes
your Composure below half, you might describe how your will to fight is
shaken and you are considering fleeing. Other creatures in the game, at
the DM's discretion, might undergo other effects or changes when their
Composure is broken; they might lose heart and try to escape, or they
could launch into a frenzy of fury. Some creatures might even have weak
points which, if hit, allow you to immediately break their Composure,
bringing them down to half their total Composure. Breaking Composure is
therefore an important narrative and mechanical step towards defeating
your enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Battles now naturally take on a tense cat-and-mouse game as each side
attempts to find their opponents weaknesses in order to first of all
break their composure (perhaps initiating a wide-spread retreat, or
causing the enemies to fly into a frenzy) and having to then deal with
the outcome of these (perhaps quite different) enemies. I don't want to
sound too much like a porn site advertisement, but this one simple trick
really did change my games completely - and I hope it can change yours,
too! I hope doctors don't hate me for it!</p>
