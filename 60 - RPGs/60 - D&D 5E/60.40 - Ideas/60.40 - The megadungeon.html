<h1 id="the-megadungeon">The megadungeon</h1>
<h2 id="megadungeon-as-a-style-of-play">Megadungeon as a style of
play</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Dark Souls, you measure your progress in several things - areas
cleared, bonfires lit, and bosses defeated. In Megadungeons, you measure
your progress in rooms cleared.</li>
<li>Dark Souls uses the idea of a room as a metaphorical thing. A room
is any place where a thing is located. Firelink Shrine and the NPCs are
a room. The cemetery below is a room with the skeletons which do not
stay down. Keeping it simple like this can make designing a Megadungeon
much easier.</li>
<li>Dark Souls tells story through this process - each region has a tale
told by the order of its rooms, and the encounters in those rooms. While
designing your own megadungeon, think in these terms. How can the rooms
and the encounters tell a story?</li>
<li>In this way, Megadungeon is a style of play, rather than a location.
It's a style of play that focuses on the ROOM and the ENCOUNTER and how
those are linked together to tell a story.</li>
<li>Continuing the war example: the battlefield region could have 1.)
foxholes filled with terrified soldiers, 2.) a trench with wounded men
clogging the route, 3.) front lines with constant machine gun fire and
an incompetent commander, 4.) no man's land, with enemies charging with
bayonets. This tells a story of the region, and the players that move
through it will forward the story of the Party.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-beauty-of-the-5e-adventure-day">The Beauty of the 5e
Adventure Day</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dark Souls is a game of attrition. Resources are your only way of
survival. Health, Stamina, estus, spells, etc. This. Is. D&amp;D.</li>
<li>In 5e, health, HD, spells, potions, etc. are the resources you need
to continue adventuring.</li>
<li>In Dark Souls, reaching a bonfire is a goal because it means rest
and replenishing resources. In 5e, this is the adventure day.</li>
<li>The adventure day - typically - says that a party can handle 5-8
encounters from easy-hard difficulty before needing a long rest. During
this day you can have short rests to expend HD and replenish certain
abilities.</li>
<li>You can use this in your Megadungeon game to create story. Nothing
is more exciting and tension driven in Dark Souls than when you're
running low on everything and having to decide whether you are going
back or moving forward in hopes of a bonfire.</li>
<li>Take this example and place safe spots (bonfires) in your
Megadungeon. Place them at the end of Adventuring days.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<ul>
<li>Taking a look at Dark Souls as an example of excellent design - From
Firelink Shrine to the first bonfire, there are 5 necessary encounters:
the undead on the stairs, the undead playing dead, the undead where the
dragon lands, the crossbow undead, and the undead with the shields and
spears. Each one takes place in its own "room", with the crossbow-men
being able to fire down on you while taking on another encounter.</li>
<li>Not only this but there are 3 optional rooms for extra XP and
treasure - the rat in the sewer guarding the humanity, the secret jump
to get the treasure in the building, and the hidden NPC downstairs which
sells stuff.</li>
<li>That's the perfect example of how to design an adventure day. In
D&amp;D that entire thing might take a session, maybe two, depending.
And when you start looking at Dark Souls like that, you can see that all
areas are the same. And they USE the Adventure Day to build tension.
Sometimes making them shorter, and sometimes forcing you to go 14-15
encounters before reaching the next one.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="adventure-day-continued">Adventure Day Continued</h2>
<ul>
<li>When designing your regions for your Megadungeon, use the idea of
the adventure day to add another layer to the story. The layer which
taxes the players resource management. With this, you have both layer of
the game engaged - the characters and their buy-in, and the players with
their character sheets.</li>
<li>Continuing the war example: after crossing no-man's land, the
opposing force is pushed back and the Party can finally rest before
being awoken by artillery the next day.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-npcs">The importance of NPCs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dark Souls uses NPCs for very few reasons - covenants,
buying/selling, and optional story. But all of these impact the world of
Dark Souls, a lonely world where you make it on your own.</li>
<li>Let this influence your own NPC design. Let the theme of your world
influence your NPC design.</li>
<li>Ask yourself what role they fill. Are they here to buy/sell? What
would a buyer/seller look like in your world?</li>
<li>In this hypothetical war campaign, a buyer/seller would be the guy
at the barracks, or a medic on the field, or the guy riding around in
the jeep with all the bullets.</li>
<li>The other NPCs, keep their story on an optional level, but don't be
worried about having NPCs reappear, like when Big Hat Logan shows up
after being freed.</li>
<li>Have NPCs disappear, like the Cleric that stands near the back of
Firelink. If this draws interest, then great, if not, then that's one
less NPC you have to worry about.</li>
<li>NPCs as optional stories in the War Campaign could be a soldier that
joins the squad, a tank sergeant that keeps needing help, a daring spy
that is offering coin for info, a cartographer that needs help mapping
the enemy territory. People that can enrich the world, but aren't
necessary if the party isn't interested.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="locks-keys-and-gates">Locks, Keys, and Gates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dark Souls has <em>some</em> backtracking, to say the least. There
are doors that can't be opened, paths that shouldn't be travelled,
creatures which can't be beat. These require you to go do some other
shit then come back later.</li>
<li>When designing your regions, don't hesitate to put in rooms that
need a key. Just like the room, the key can be metaphorical.</li>
<li>In the War Campaign, a key can be a new rank that gives access to
new areas/information, it can be a commanding officer that you have to
get in good with, it can be an injury that puts you in a new location
for recovery.</li>
<li>5e has some locked gates built in - certain spells such as Fly allow
access to the air in a new way. Water breathing potions/spells give you
access to new locations. Druid wild shapes could give access to animal
areas previous unallowed. Paladin oaths can give you access to
locations. Perhaps your wizard school gives access to a certain portion
of the library others can't go to.</li>
<li>You can use both 5e's system and your world's theme to build your
own series of locks/keys/gates and place them around your regions to
have your own little secrets.</li>
<li>When someone finally discovers one and unlocks it...it'll make it
all worth it.</li>
