<h1 id="a-system-for-stealth-missions">A system for stealth
missions</h1>
<p>Stealth and infiltration missions are fun in video games, but are
more difficult to implement in D&amp;D.</p>
<p>In video games, stealth usually goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You find your target, observe the guard patrols, and plan out my
path into the base.</li>
<li>You immediately blow my cover by throwing a hunk of meat at a guard
instead of assassinating him.</li>
<li>You ditch stealth in favour of just gunning down anything that
moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>In D&amp;D, this is the equivalent of failing the first stealth check
and the whole party immediately giving up on any plans they might have
had in favour of a drawn out combat encounter. This can be less fun for
a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single failed check ruined the entire plan.</li>
<li>The players felt like tactical geniuses and now they do not.</li>
<li>There is no recovery; you’ve been spotted once and now all of China
knows you’re here.</li>
</ul>
<p>The way to solve this is by using an Alarm Levels system. The alarm
system represents the guards’ increasing suspicion and panic, as well as
their increasingly drastic attempts to put a stop to the characters.
Each mission starts at Alarm Level 0, and escalates up to alarm level 6.
It takes 5 points to reach the next level. At the end of every round, a
point is added. Every time a character is detected, a point is added.
Other things, like setting off sensors or killing guards, also add
points. Every time the alarm level increases, a new threat is
introduced, such as additional guard patrols or new cameras going
online.</p>
<p>The Alarm system achieves two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides a system to steadily increase urgency and tension both
narratively and mechanically. It does this in response to both the
passage of time and specific character actions.</li>
<li>It makes it so that mistakes have specific, meaningful consequences
without being overly punishing. Players are rewarded for adaptability,
while not being punished so harshly for taking risks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-1-creating-triggers">Step 1: Creating Triggers</h2>
<p>First, you need to assign point values to different triggers. For
example, failing a Deception check will increase suspicion by a
significant amount, so you can say that that event adds a point of
suspicion to the alarm level. Overtly hostile actions, however, should
raise the alarm level at a much more dramatic rate, so you can assign
higher point scores to those triggers. Here’s a good list of
triggers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Failed Stealth, Sleight of Hand, or Deception check (1 Point)</li>
<li>End of any combat round (1 Point)</li>
<li>Caught in a restricted area (2 Points)</li>
<li>Unconscious body found (2 Points)</li>
<li>Murder witnessed/Dead body found (4 Points)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add as many or as few specific triggers as you want. You can
of course just add points on the fly as you see appropriate, but it’s
more helpful for the players to know exactly what they’re working with.
This lets them make calculated risks and get tactical with their
decision making.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-creating-threats">Step 2: Creating Threats</h2>
<p>Each time the alarm level increases, a new threat is introduced to
the situation. They start small at first, but grow more severe the
higher the alarm level. It's a good idea to keep these a secret from the
players until they happen. Here’s an example.</p>
<p>Alarm Level Threats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 0: Everything is operating as normal.</li>
<li>Level 1: Guards are slightly more suspicious: +1 DC to checks
against them.</li>
<li>Level 2: An additional guard patrol arrives.</li>
<li>Level 3: The director is alerted and all patients are sent to
rooms.</li>
<li>Level 4: The facility is locked down and an additional guard patrol
arrives.</li>
<li>Level 5: The director scrys on the party, revealing their current
location to all guards.</li>
<li>Level 6: A pair of CR 5 Blood Hunters arrive and close on the
party’s location.</li>
</ul>
<p>There can be any number of Alarm levels, but 6 works well. Levels 1
and 2 are fairly relaxed, the characters are taking their time and
exploring the facility, and security is unaware of their presence.
Levels 3 and 4 put some more pressure on the party by changing the
situation in some way. Players and characters are starting to make some
mistakes and take some risks, the party is getting closer to its goal,
and security is aware that there is some sort of threat. By levels 5 and
6, it’s go time. The party is sprinting instead of sneaking, their
location is being compromised, and they’re starting to take more
desperate risks. Security is fully aware of the threat and are becoming
more and more equipped to deal with it. Hitting alarm level 6 is a great
dramatic moment. When each alarm level hits, narrating a little cutscene
of the new threat really sells the rising urgency.</p>
