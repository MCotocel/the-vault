<h1
id="four-rules-and-practices-that-encourage-chaotic-rp-heavy-combat">Four
rules and practices that encourage chaotic, RP-heavy combat</h1>
<h2 id="implement-enforce-a-110-timescale-in-combat">Implement &amp;
Enforce a 1:10 Timescale in Combat</h2>
<p>A common complaint of 5e combat is that it can feel slow and boring.
When one PC, or worse, the whole party, frequently take 10+ minutes per
turn, combat loses its edge pretty quickly. Nothing feels urgent or
exciting. If anything it feels boring.</p>
<p>This problem is frequently addressed by implementing a 1:10
Timescale, or the 1-minute max per turn rule. Each round in combat is
said to last 6 seconds so your players get 60 to decide upon their
actions. Failure to do so represents indecision or hesitation of their
character. They lose their turn in that round of combat as a result.</p>
<p>Allow for your players to ask questions. Questions regarding enemy
position, numbers, land features,or other logistics result in the timer
being paused because that represents your failure as DM to paint a clear
picture. Spell or game mechanic questions are only allowed an extra
minute. If that minute ends up and they aren’t quite sure or satisfied
how a certain spell or feature may affect their situation, they must
either choose to do it anyways or try another action with no questions
asked. So at the very most, each player only gets 2 minutes if they are
clarifying something.</p>
<p>### The RP Effect of Rule 1:</p>
<p>Enforcing this rule gives combat a hectic, pressured feeling in which
not all turns are optimal nor 100% strategic - but that’s OK. In fact,
your character does not have much time to strategise with 6 angry
goblins trying to stab them while they nervously watch an ogre tossing
their friend across the battlefield. Things are bound to be a little
chaotic and rushed. Maybe your action ends up upsetting the plan of the
player next to you? Good! Now they have to think on their feet too. It
also encourages better communication between your players after this
happens a few times. View this as an opportunity for your players to
level up their party strategy &amp; communication skills!</p>
<h2
id="answer-will-this-work-from-their-own-character-perspective.">Answer
“Will this Work?” from their own character perspective.</h2>
<p>When players ask “Will it work if I X?”, try to represent their
character knowledge to answer the question without breaking immersion
with mechanics or feeling overly gamey. For example, your wizard asks
“If I cast X on this, will I be able to Y?” Answer from their own
character’s knowledge. IE: “In his years practising magic, he has never
encountered nor read of using a spell for that purpose - he honestly has
no idea what will happen. Roll arcana if you attempt to use the spell
that way.” Or “Given the nature of the spell, he is very confident he
can manipulate it to accomplish just that.” Establish an appropriate DC
based on how reasonable the request is.</p>
<p>That being said, rule of cool has its place and it's encouraged to
reward players for creative ideas providing they aren’t overly
ridiculous! Even if something doesn’t quite work the way they wanted,
try to give some kind of benefit or outcome so they don’t feel their
turn was entirely wasted. In other words, reward appropriate creativity,
don’t punish it!</p>
<h3 id="the-rp-effect-for-rule-2">The RP Effect for Rule 2:</h3>
<p>Players begin to feel as if their character truly has their own
experience and knowledge. Rather than relying upon you, the DM, as the
purveyor of whether or not they get to do cool thing “X” or not players
feel as if the agency of that action lies with them rather than with a
game system.</p>
<p>It demands players act from limited knowledge as they can never be
certain from the eyes of a mortal adventurer. Acting on a gut feeling
&amp; taking a risk is exciting!</p>
<p>There is also great fun to be had when this becomes an arena for
character flaws to manifest. Your character’s flaw is pride and
overconfidence? “Yeah - sure it’s outlandish and your character has
never seen this before, but they are super certain they can pull this
off.” <em>laughs in DM</em></p>
<h2 id="the-1-sentence-rule-strategy-mid-combat">The 1 Sentence Rule
&amp; Strategy Mid-Combat</h2>
<p>This ruling really depends on the vibe of your table. Do they love
hashing out the perfect strategy mid-combat? Is that fun to them or does
that bog down the table? If it's part of their fun, then don't change
anything! However there’s usually only 1 player at most that likes to
strategise to that degree. Unfortunately, that usually leads to a
tendency in which they tell the other players what to do on their turns
for the most optional action. Not the most fun.</p>
<p>Each round in combat is only 6 seconds. At most, your character has
time to say one sentence, or maybe two short ones, to communicate with
their party. Each round, your player gets 1 "communication" or sentence
for strategic use with their party. You can say this sentence at any
point in the initiative, your turn, an ally’s, or even an enemy’s. But
that’s it. You want to fireball in the centre of the room but your turn
isn’t until after your gutsy fighter? Better warn him before his
initiative. "Alanys takes this opportunity to say 'Boris, take the
goblin on the left, just avoid the centre!” Need a heal? Want the enemy
caster dead? Say it in character. Keep it brief.</p>
<h3 id="the-rp-effect-of-rule-3">The RP Effect of Rule 3:</h3>
<p>This rule encourages in-character communication within the party. It
also meshes well with the 10:1 timescale rule, making turns feel
chaotic. It limits your strategy to nothing more than what your
character could say. You only have time for one sentence to keep some
semblance of order in combat. No more slow, chess game turns. Simpler
enemies can suddenly become more threatening if your party fails to
communicate effectively.</p>
<p>It also either eliminates or reduces the extent to which that one guy
who loves Total War can command around your other players while giving
them equal chance to play the strategist. Everybody gets a
sentence/round.</p>
<p>It also encourages your party to come up with “your party playbook.”
Figure out a cool, synergistic combination for your characters to
perform? Good, now that’s a reproducible strategy you can implement
across battles with minimal need to talk it out. It makes your party
feel more like a cohesive, effective unit. It encourages your party to
reflect &amp; talk out of combat. Get totally wrecked last encounter?
What went wrong? What can we try if it happens again? Do something
awesome? Let's try that again! (It also lets you interrupt their usual
strategies with enemy immunities or unique combat layouts to force them
to frantically try plan B or improvise!) <em>laughs harder in
DM</em></p>
<h2 id="no-moment-is-without-risk-out-of-combat-strategy">No moment is
without risk: Out of Combat Strategy</h2>
<p>Sometimes your players manage to effectively scout or sneak into an
enemy territory without being caught. Keeping a bit of tension while
they strategise here also goes a long way to encourage RP and keep
things exciting.</p>
<p>Strategising right under the nose of the enemy? Everything minute in
discussion results in another stealth roll to determine if you are
discovered.</p>
<p>Scout with a familiar or scry from another room? Try rolling every
few minutes to determine random events/ encounters. Players should
recognise that more time spent here means the enemies may shift
position, receive reinforcements, etc. Nothing should feel static. Try
to cap this strategisation at 10-15 minutes at most to keep the game
moving.</p>
<h3 id="the-rp-effect-of-rule-4">The RP Effect of rule 4:</h3>
<p>Combat now feels risky even when not directly in combat. You are
either in battle or heading towards one. Your plans can be interrupted
or upset at any moment depending on your proximity. Strategising under
the enemies nose? You must weigh the benefits of acting with surprise
now, even with a half-baked plan, versus the risk of discovery and
getting no surprise. Too much going on to act on within the next minute
or two? Maybe try retreating to ponder the situation. Or strategising
from relative safety? Every minute without your eyes on the enemy could
result in some change in situation. Or the risk of a random enemy
stumbling upon you and raising an alarm. Maybe you didn’t scout very
well and missed the reinforcements headed your way? Take them on now as
quietly as possible and run the risk of being wedged between two groups
if you make too much noise, or hide with the risk of fighting one
larger, reinforced group? “You get 1 minute until they roll perception,
decide.” The goal is that every moment of strategy should still feel
chaotic and compelling. It should feel as though there are pros and
cons, risks and rewards.</p>
