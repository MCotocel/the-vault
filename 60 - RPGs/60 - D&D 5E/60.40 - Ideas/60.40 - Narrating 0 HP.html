<h1 id="narrating-0-hp">Narrating 0 HP</h1>
<p>The last thing you remember seeing were the goblin's eyes gleaming as
it slashed its scimitar across your body. Your vision faded, and
suddenly you were awake, the pain was gone. You look around and you find
yourself in a small circular room. In the centre, there is an archway
standing on a pedestal, a lightly billowing veil shrouds the other side
of the arch. On the wall directly behind you you can see a plain
doorway. You know that your body is on the other side of that door,
lying on the cold stone floor of the goblin infested dungeon.</p>
<p>There are others in this room with you. Around the ring of the room,
you see several other humanoids in pairs, looking closer you recognise
them faintly as the goblins your party has dispatched. Each goblin is
being escorted by a tall robed figure towards the pedestal in the middle
of the room. The air is very still here, it is peaceful.</p>
<p>Next to you stands a similar tall robed figure as the others you see
in the room. It wordlessly beckons you toward the pedestal in the centre
of the room. You understand its meaning. <em>It is time to go. She
awaits you. Your time in this world is at an end.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What do you do?</strong></p>
<p><em>I don't want to die. I'm going to run for the door.</em></p>
<p><strong>Roll me a D20. The DC is 10. There are no bonuses here, no
weapons, no magics. This is the veiled room, and all souls are equal
here.</strong></p>
<p><em>5, Balls</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You turn and try to run for the door, suddenly though it is further
away. The figure standing next to you places its hand on your shoulder
and ushers you gently toward the archway.</p>
<p>The combat round continues. No one moves to help their downed
comrade. Their turn.</p>
<p>The figure stands over you, its hand on your shoulder, ushering you
firmly but not roughly towards the centre of the room. Several of the
goblins you saw before have disappeared through the veil as you watched.
They all looked so peaceful as they walked though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What do you do?</strong></p>
<p><em>I'm going to punch the figure. 15.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You throw the figures hand off your shoulder and strike at it. The
blow lands, and the figure steps back momentarily. You see that the
archway has receded, and you stand much closer to the door in the wall
than you did before.</p>
<p>The combat round continues. Again no one moves to help their downed
comrade, the fight is raging still. Their turn once again.</p>
<p>The robed figure has stepped back towards you and you can feel their
icy gaze under the hood. One hand of theirs is extended to take yours,
the other gestures toward the veil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What do you do?</strong></p>
<p><em>I'm running for the door again. 9. Damn.</em></p>
<p><strong>2 failures, 1 success. One more Failure and you will pass
through the veil.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The figure takes your hand and you find yourself unable to resist as
it leads you toward the centre of the room. You notice now that there
are other exits from this room than the two you have seen before. One is
in the ceiling, blood red and rippling with heat. One is under the
pedestal, which you now realise is suspended in mid-air. The exit below
is black, and swirls faintly.</p>
<p>Each exit has a figure sitting in its entrance, neither moves closer
into the room. But both are watching you.</p>
<p>The combat round continues. Again no one moves to help their downed
comrade, the fight is raging still. Their turn once again.</p>
<p>The robed figure is drawing you near to the veil now. You notice that
the figures in the red exit above you has stood, gestured toward you.
You hear its words in your head. <em>I can aid you. I can grant you a
reprieve from this fate. All I ask in return is that when you next face
death, you come with me instead of them. What say you?</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you accept the Devil's help, you will have advantage on
your death saves this time. But when next you find yourself here, it
will be him ushering you instead of the robed figure. He will not be so
easy to resist, you will have a -1 on each death save. Your soul will be
his to claim, and that claim can not easily be broken.</strong></p>
<p><em>I ... I don't know. I shouldn't. But I can't die, not now. I
accept. I'm running for the door again. 8, no wait a Nat 20 with
advantage!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You agree, the devil smiles, and you feel your soul fill with
strength. A glyph appears on your forearm in flaming red. The robed
figure lets go of your hand as though burned and you run for the door.
Somehow your feet fly faster than you thought possible and you slam
through the door. Your eyes burst open and you see the battle continues
to rage around you. You have 1 HP.</p>
<h2 id="dropping-to-0-hp-sucks">Dropping to 0 HP Sucks</h2>
<p>Not only are you just about dead, but you're also just sitting around
waiting for someone to help you, or waiting to make 1 die roll on your
turn while everyone else is doing the fun stuff that D&amp;D is made of.
It's anti-climatic and it can leave a very sour taste in the mouth of a
new player in particular if they should go down early in a fight.</p>
<p>So here's a proposal for all of you running games to make dropping to
0 a <em>little</em> more interesting. Basically, 0 Hp is "death before
death." You find yourself in some limbo state where your soul is being
ushered on to the next life. All souls are equal here, no weapons, no
magic, the mechanics are exactly the same as making Death Saves, the
setting is just different.</p>
<h3 id="the-ingredients">The Ingredients</h3>
<h4 id="place">Place</h4>
<p>The scenario above uses a room obviously inspired by <a
href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Veil">the Veil</a> from Harry
Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Another source of inspiration would
be the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Limbo">Limbo</a>
scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, where the player might
find themselves in a place that has great significance to them. Use
Dream Logic in this place, the character knows things they haven't been
told because they intuit them.</p>
<h4 id="aspect-of-death">Aspect of Death</h4>
<p>Either the <a
href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadar-kai">Shadar
Kai</a>, a Reaper, a Ferryman, or something else that fits in with your
world's afterlife stands with the player in this room. They are there to
usher them firmly but without hostility through to the beyond. Nothing
you can do will harm them as this is their dominion, but you can resist
their pull.</p>
<h4 id="soul-or-a-few">Soul (or a few)</h4>
<p>Whether you allow other creatures who have <em>died</em> "nearby" to
be present with the player or not is up to you. It could lead to some
interesting opportunities though. If two players are <em>dying</em> at
the same time, it could be allowed to let one sacrifice a save to grant
it to the other. Or you could go the other way and make this experience
fully personal. Just the player and their aspect of death.</p>
<h4 id="some-other-entities-optional">Some other Entities
(optional)</h4>
<p>Above, I have a Demon and a Devil hoping to tantalise powerful souls
passing on with the chance to waylay death in exchange for the soul as
currency. This grants a mechanical boon now and a debuff later. All of
this is obviously optional but it could lead to some interesting
plotlines. If a player was particularly devout in life, their god might
be represented here either ushering them onward or allowing them a
reprieve to finish some work yet undone.</p>
<h4 id="death-saves">Death Saves</h4>
<p>Anything the player wants to do (short of willingly surrender their
soul to death) requires a Death Save. All normal death save mechanics
are the same.</p>
<h3 id="have-fun-with-it">Have fun with it</h3>
<p>The tricky bit I suppose is to not make this take too much time in
combat. Combat already drags a lot and a dead character isn't
contributing anyway, so it's a good idea to keep their turns as short as
possible. Obviously the first time you spring this on a group it'll take
more explaining than the second time.</p>
<p>The goal here is to give the "dying" player something to do other
than sit around and do nothing. They have full agency in how they resist
death. The fighter might want to punch the aspect of death, the wizard
might challenge it to a game of wits, the rogue might want to run really
fast. Everything goes, but this is Death's Domain, and your soul has no
bonuses here (obviously things that affect death saves are the exception
here).</p>
<p>It's also a way to let the DM flex their narration a little bit for
the fun of it. A healing spell or potion could be described as banishing
the aspect of death and pulling the soul back through the door into the
body. Taking damage while downed could be a massive sword piercing the
door and pushing you closer to the veil.</p>
