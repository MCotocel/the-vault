<blockquote>
<p>The party is venturing in a ruined castle when they noticed in the
corridor in front of them a door is ajar, and a sliver of flickering
light, probably from a torch, comes out of it. As they get close, they
can hear faint voices, people discussing something. The heroes reach the
door and peek inside, cautiously: Two men stand in the room, in front of
a large wooden chest sitting in the middle. One of the man leans against
a wall with a torch in his hand and an angered expression on his face.
The other is kneeling in front of the chest, giving his shoulders to the
door. They both seem dressed like common adventurers or explorers, and
decently armed. "Don't do it, Jeff, you know these places are full of
traps." Says the first man. "Stop worrying, I checked, there is
nothing-" Before the second man can finish, the wooden chest springs
open, revealing a hideous mouth and a long tongue. The man has barely
time to scream before the horrible creature has engulfed him, only his
legs peek out of the monster, swinging wildly. Blood drips all over. The
first men yells, pulls his sword and jumps to attack the monster, when
the heroes, burst into the room, ready to fight with him. In an instant
they have surrounded the beast, the unknown adventurer is about to
strike first, He lifts his sword, and swings. At one of the heroes. At
the same time, the door slams closed, and a set of teeth appears around
it from the walls. A foul-smelling, thick liquid oozes from floor and
walls. Before the group has time to realize what is going on, the chest
hurls itself at them, with the man still trapped inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For in truth, there never was a man. Or a chest. The entire room,
including the mimic and the two adventurers in it, are fake, and part of
the actual mimic that forms the entire room and the scenario taking
place in it. And the heroes have already fallen for its devious trick,
now trapped inside him.</p>
<p>Many adventurers will expect danger from abandoned chests, the most
seasoned will be wary even of a simple room or corridor, and always be
on the lookout for traps and tricks. But there is one moment where
almost nobody will be on his guard, when nobody fully expect a mimic:
when the fight with the mimic has already started.</p>
<p>Nobody goes to look for a mimic when one is already out. Their
attention drawn to the fake mimic, forced by the situation to hurry,
they'll be unprepared for the real trap.</p>
<p>The mimic room mimic is a very large, powerful and smart mimic that
creates an enticing scenario of people being attacked by a mimic to
lower the guard of its victims as much as possible, in a matrioshka of
mimicry.</p>
<p>The mimic attaches itself to the dungeon structure and grows to fill
an entire room, replacing only the entrance door completely, so that
leaving it once it has attacked is very hard.</p>
<p>The mimic is very clever, it can use vibrations in the walls and
floors he's attacked to to perceive sounds, learn the position of the
party and start its scenario just so that they reach it at the pivotal
moment.</p>
<p>If the adventurers were to look for it, they could notice the inside
of the room doesn't look quite right, at a deeper observation: the
texture of the objects in it isn't quite perfect, and it's very
noticeable if touched. It also exudes its digestive juices at all times,
even if in small and hard to notice quantities, they can be smelled or
seen before the fight starts. In any case the room inside and outside is
dimly lit, making all of that hard to notice.</p>
<p>Spells that look for living creatures will obviously reveal the trap,
and so will a deep examination of the entrance door: The mimic relies on
the adventurers being too busy to pay attention, its fine details aren't
quite perfect.</p>
<p>Once the fight started, the mimic will attack with pseudopods trying
to bash the heroes. The two fake adventurers and the fake mimic are in
fact nothing more than that, fleshy extensions of the mimic, and they
are pseudopods in themselves. Their swords not real metal. A very
careful observer will notice the feet of the two are, very loosely,
attacked to the floor with a fleshy filament under their boots. The room
can spawn other, normal looking pseudopods to fight other adventurers if
3 aren't enough.</p>
<p>The room also exudes acidic juices that can drip on people and do
acid damage, they also rapidly coat the walls causing damage to any that
touches them. In a few minutes, the room runs out of air and is filled
with toxic gas.</p>
<p>The door to the fake room turns into a jaw, and it's firmly locked,
it is also made of flesh material and not wood making it much harder to
break through, it is also coated in acid as well.</p>
<p>Once the room has killed its victims, it will take a few days
digesting them, any gear that can't be digested will be attacked to the
fake adventurers to make them look more realistic for future traps.
While digesting, the mimic is weakened and drowsy and the trap will not
happen. The door will simply change shape to look like a section of
wall, hiding the mimic room mimic.</p>
