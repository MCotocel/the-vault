<h1 id="the-grey-gourmet-society">The Grey Gourmet Society</h1>
<p>Everybody knows and fears the Illithid, the dreaded mind flayers,
psionic brain-devouring monsters of the Underdark, but even among these
monsters, some stand out.</p>
<p>Especially powerful illithids, especially evil ones, and in some
cases, illithids with unique tastes.</p>
<p>They eat brains, sure, but some are pickier than others. Some have
preferences, unique preferences, and require specialised skills to
acquire the kind of brain they crave.</p>
<p>Some of those mind flayers have gathered together in a secret
society, known only by hushed whispers and nervous rumours even between
the denizens of the Underdark.</p>
<p>A small and exclusive society, that over many centuries and many
generations have accumulated an incredible amount of wealth, connections
and power.</p>
<p>Each of its members has specific tastes and is willing to pay any sum
and commit any crime to get their tentacles on the type of brain they
desire.</p>
<h2 id="the-grey-gourmet-society-1">The Grey Gourmet Society</h2>
<p>The society is ancient, but it has maintained a sort of consistent
structure: eight seats, eight mind flayers, eight tastes.</p>
<p>The members are known by their titles, not by their names so that
even if one dies, their replacement can maintain an illusion of unbroken
power. Over the centuries the organisation has accumulated riches,
connections and knowledge, but only they know the real extent of their
power: they bow to no master, no god and no elder brain, and live
separately from mind flayer society, even tho they maintain secret
connections with them, trading interesting and valuable brains, slaves
and information.</p>
<p>They are used to working with “inferior races”, humans, elves, orcs
and everything else that could be useful, hiring them as mercenaries,
servants, informers and collectors. They are very practical and
pragmatic.</p>
<p>They work independently, and sometimes even fight with each other
when they happen to compete for the same brain or their plans conflict
with each other. The society only rule is to not murder each other.
Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>They rarely meet in person but are expected to keep constant
communications and share information with the group.</p>
<p>If any of them is killed, captured or disappears, the others will
learn about it in a short time.</p>
<h2 id="the-eight-seats">The eight seats</h2>
<h3 id="the-gourmet-of-beasts">The Gourmet of Beasts</h3>
<p>Also known as Gourmet of the Wild, Guy Flayeri or The Apex Predator,
this Illithid eats the brains of rare animals. The sensation of eating a
creature at risk of extinction, perhaps the very last of its species, or
eating some creature that nobody else has ever eaten, nothing can
compare.</p>
<p>It has eaten hundreds of creatures, some that almost no other mortal
has ever seen, and never will see.</p>
<h4 id="allies">Allies</h4>
<p>This Gourmet is one of the most “social”: to acquire its food. It
employs a vast net of hunters, merchants and zoos, that scour the world
for strange and unusual animals. Almost none of them know who they’re
working for, and mots of them are only temporary allies.</p>
<p>In any trading post, hunting expedition or mercantile hub, in any
country of every plane, you can expect to find at least one person that
has been paid to keep an eye out for new creatures on behalf of somebody
else working for somebody else, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Even some druids and rangers work for it, often thinking they’re
interacting with another druid interested in protecting vulnerable
species, or some zoologist, or any number of fake identities.</p>
<h4 id="lair">Lair</h4>
<p>The Gourmet of Beasts owns a vast zoo, with thousands of rare
creatures. It attracts nobles and experts from all over the land. The
Illithid often mingles with regular people, hiding its identity with
countless spells, and many people know it as a wealthy and pleasant
fellow with a deep love for animals.</p>
<p>In the middle of this Zoo, there is his residence. Walls are lined
with the embalmed heads of thousands of creatures, the floors covered in
fur carpets, and animal bone and horns have been used to make pretty
much everything here, from chairs to cutlery to lamps to buttons on the
guards' shirts.</p>
<h4 id="plot-hooks">Plot Hooks</h4>
<ul>
<li>A friendly old man hires the players to capture some very rare
animal. It’s for a collector, he says. The beast will be cared for with
love. The old man is strangely rich, and the players may find he has
plenty of other animals locked up in the basement of his house.</li>
<li>A very ancient and rare creature used to bless the forest, but it
recently disappeared. The local druids beg the players to look for it,
wherever its traces may lead them.</li>
<li>The players land on an island that is supposed to be untouched by
civilisation, but find somebody has arrived before them. The island is
strangely silent, and many of the unique and undiscovered species living
there seem to have disappeared.</li>
<li>A powerful explosion rocks the town. Someone has attacked a local
menagerie. The players are asked to investigate, but soon learn the
supposed terrorists seem to have a good motivation, for freeing those
animals: They are being sent to a monster, to be eaten, or at least
that’s what the terrorists say.</li>
<li>A terrible monster attacks the town, and a group of hunters helps
the players stopping it. They are talented and arrived just at the right
time. They want to reward, only to be allowed to capture and carry away
the creature. If the players look into them, they find out that their
timing was suspiciously good, and it’s unclear why they want the beast
so badly.</li>
<li>A local old woman, a few days ago, was bragging that she had found a
rare animal, a creature of legends, known only in fables. She was very
cheerful and proud, but something changed: she became incredibly rich
out of nowhere, and stopped talking about the animal. She also seems to
be expecting a visitor, soon.</li>
<li>An enormous sum of money is offered to the players to venture into a
cave complex and find a certain animal. As they dive deep, they find the
many bodies of those sent before them. Their employer seems nervous, and
something is sketchy about its identity.</li>
<li>A group of local mercenaries tries to kidnap the animal companion of
one of the players and carry them through a portal, the Gourmet of
Beasts awaits this famous beast for its meal.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="combat">Combat</h4>
<p>The Illithid is often accompanied by evil druids and rangers that the
Illithid trusts deeply, plus a number of trained animals and
shape-shifters, such as werewolves.</p>
<p>The Gourmet itself is physically stronger, thicker-skinned and larger
than a regular mind flayer, and possesses shapeshifting abilities
similar to those of a druid, but it can mutate in the countless animals
it has eaten.</p>
<p>When at low life, it can fall into a brutal rage, similar to that of
a barbarian, effectively turning into a dangerous, cornered animal.
Fights with this creature will involve a lot more melee than expected
from an illithid.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>Every 1d6 round, mentally calls a large beast to its aid.</p>
<h3 id="the-gourmet-of-magic">The Gourmet of Magic</h3>
<p>Also known as the Wizard Cook, The Wiz Chef or The Mage Muncher, it’s
a mind flayer with a sense of humour. It truly enjoys eating brains of
magic users, basking in the magical energy therein. It causes it a sense
of joy and glee, almost childlike.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s the effect of bathing in so much magic, but it acts in
odd ways and seems a bit out of its mind. It often tells jokes and seems
to see and hear things that aren’t there. It’s easily amused, friendly
and cordial, even with its victims.</p>
<p>Its preys, often, are extremely powerful casters, a dangerous dinner:
they aren’t just able to defend themselves or run away, but could also
find and defeat the Gourmet. It has brushed with death multiple
times.</p>
<p>Its positive attitude often misleads people, making them forget this
mind flayer is an experienced and talented hunter.</p>
<p>Its dream is to find a way to eat the brain of a lich. Impossible?
Perhaps, but in the depth of its tentacular heart, this mind flayer
still dares to hope.</p>
<h4 id="allies-1">Allies</h4>
<p>Plenty: mages that needed a rival to disappear, mage hunters,
inquisitors and preachers, arcane schools that needed a dangerous
student to be dealt with, dragon hunters.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this gourmet even works with drows, to capture beholders
or other Underdark creatures.</p>
<p>It is one of the most secretive gourmets, and almost nobody
understands what they’re doing business with.</p>
<h4 id="lair-1">Lair</h4>
<p>An ancient hidden library, holding countless tomes of arcane
knowledge and magical scrolls. Many mages come here, looking to study
its secrets. If some happen to disappear, it rarely raises questions:
it’s a dangerous journey in an isolated place, after all.</p>
<p>The place is protected by traps and golems, plus several servants
trained specifically to fight magic users. A few mages have convinced
the gourmet to spare their lives, and in exchange they work for it,
maintaining and protecting the library.</p>
<h4 id="plot-hooks-1">Plot Hooks</h4>
<ul>
<li>The magic user of the group is invited for tea by Lord Bomborelli.
The gnome has been short on money for many years, but suddenly he seems
to have found new wealth, and an interest in casters.</li>
<li>Every magic user that goes through a certain village disappears. The
players discover a secret society hidden in it, made up of apparently
regular people, that for some reason have started kidnapping travellers
with powers, to sell them to… somebody. Not even they know who the man
that comes out of the woods to buy captured mages is, but they know his
gifts well.</li>
<li>Students are protesting, and blocking the city streets. For too long
the school has ignored the strange disappearances of students, they
say.</li>
<li>An unpleasant group of mercenaries comes through town, carrying… a
living blue dragon? The beast is quite large, bound and drugged inside a
cage. Many seem wounded, it can’t have been an easy fight. They seem in
a hurry and want to leave as fast as possible. They won’t tell what
their destination is.</li>
<li>The mayor has always had arguments with Old Man Mackenzie, the weird
hermit that lives on the mountain. The locals respect his intelligence
and magical powers, even more than they respect the crown. One day,
Mackenzie disappears, and the Mayor seems wealthier than usual.</li>
<li>The king advisor is a dangerous sorceress, as charismatic as she is
ruthless. She is hindering whatever the party is trying to do. She has a
lot of political power, and the party can’t face her openly. Suddenly, a
strange figure approaches them and offers them a deal. If the party can
capture the sorceress and bring her to a certain location, she will be…
disappeared, and never heard from again. Can the players trust this
stranger? Perhaps they could even turn this around and use it to gain
the trust of the sorceress</li>
<li>Old Professor Svylean Silverbranch has disappeared, he had gone on a
journey to find a rare tome. The entire school is ready to pay top coins
to get him back, or at least confirm his death, so they can hire a new
one and not miss any more classes.T</li>
<li>A portal opens, and a wounded wizard falls out. The wizard is
scarred, and bleeding from a serious skull wound. Can’t have much longer
to live. Behind the portal, the players can see a library.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="combat-1">Combat</h4>
<p>The Mage Muncher should be ready for everything: magical items to
protect it from spells, traps, escape routes. It isn’t a great fighter,
but its library is full of passages, traps and allies.</p>
<p>Its biggest weakness is likely his strange mind: all the magic has
done a number on his brain, and sometimes this mind flayer acts in… odd
ways, that could put it in troubles.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions-1">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>Sends a wave of wild magical energy, and until its next round, an
area of a 90ft radius becomes a Wild Magic area where every spell casts
triggers a Wild Magic Surge effect chosen randomly.</p>
<h3 id="the-gourmet-of-villains">The Gourmet of Villains</h3>
<p>Also known as The Righteous Chef or The Kitchen Judge, this Mind
Flayer only eats the most wicked brains, sinful and criminal, cunning
and ruthless.</p>
<p>Its preys are dangerous, and often well-connected, so this Gourmet
has a lot of enemies in the underworld, but also between law
enforcement: more than once it has eaten crooked politicians, generals
and nobles.</p>
<p>Still, most of its targets live dangerous lives, and few people
notice their disappearance as anything unusual, even fewer take the risk
of looking for them.</p>
<p>It regularly buys prisoners, the prisons then fake their death in
some accident or simply act as if they never existed.</p>
<p>The Mind Flayer dresses and acts like a judge, it’s an act it likes
to put up to amuse itself. Despite what it says, it’s not a very lawful
Illithid and there is nothing it won’t do, to win a fight or capture a
target.</p>
<h4 id="allies-2">Allies</h4>
<p>A large number of criminals happy to see a rival removed and
authoritarian lawmakers that are happy to see lowlifes disappear work
with this Mind Flayer.</p>
<p>Almost all of them think it is just some sort of vigilante or a
sadistic nobleman, but it’s generally understood that its victims will
be killed, and they have no problem with it.</p>
<p>Many Jailers and prison wardens are on its paybook.</p>
<p>There is a small number of nobles that knows its identity and pay to
be spectators of the fights in the arena. It’s a very exclusive club.
Some of those nobles are drow.</p>
<p>A small army of drow guards, hired by the noble guests, works as
security. They also have monsters and beasts.</p>
<h4 id="lair-2">Lair</h4>
<p>A vast underground labyrinth. Capture targets wake up in it, lost,
and are told if they find the exit they will let go.</p>
<p>If they do reach the exit, they instead wake up in a courtroom,
chained up. They are subject to a mock trial, then they get eaten. There
is no way out.</p>
<p>The labyrinth is full of traps, roaming monsters and prisoners. It’s
a sort of battle royale, there are no rules, but factions can form
between the prisoners with their own internal laws. Sometimes they last
for a while, often they end in backstabbings and tragedy.</p>
<p>Some of the prisoners have survived for years and managed to form
semi-stable societies with their fellow inmates.</p>
<p>Littered around the labyrinth are both food and weapons, potions and
scrolls. The Mind Flayer spies on all the guests of the prison and
amuses itself watching them do immoral things to survive.</p>
<h4 id="plot-hooks-2">Plot Hooks</h4>
<ul>
<li>The players had a contact in the crime world, but the contact
suddenly disappeared. Nobody wants to investigate, not even the contact
own gang.</li>
<li>A big crime lord disappeared, sending the town criminal scene into a
frenzy. Violence is rapidly raising, and a full war could start at any
moment.</li>
<li>The players are hired to track down a serial killer. They break into
his hideout and find a group of masked people trying to capture him and
drag him away.</li>
<li>The players have had to interact with a politician that everybody
knows is a corrupt bastard for a while, but when they are invited for a
meeting, they find his house destroyed and everybody gone.</li>
<li>One of the players has been accused of a terrible crime. The police
are on their tracks, but they suddenly take a backseat to the strange
masked drows that keep attacking the party.</li>
<li>The players are hired by a sketchy noble that needs bodyguards for a
trip. The destination is not clear, some sort of arena?</li>
<li>A gang contacts the player: some of their members were arrested, and
disappeared in prison. Criminals as they may be, they still have rights
and are ready to compromise with the players, if they can find out
what’s happening.</li>
<li>The players wake up in a strange stone labyrinth, the sounds of
screams and clashing metal echo in the distance.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="combat-2">Combat</h4>
<p>This Mind Flayer isn’t a fighter, and prefers to let its minions do
the dirty work. If forced, it uses a mallet.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions-2">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>Every 5 round, with a movement action, the Mind Flayer can accuse an
enemy and instantly cast a spell of its choice between "Banishment",
"Dispel Magic", "Dominate Person" or "Hold Monster".</p>
<h3 id="the-gourmet-of-nobles">The Gourmet of Nobles</h3>
<p>Also known as The Blue-Blooded Gourmet, or The Royal Chef, this Mind
Flayer only wants the best brains there are. Superior brains of the
superior class, aristocratic brains, brains with a lineage, with a
pedigree.</p>
<p>It has no time for filthy peasant brains, and those that have bought
their titles are nothing but impostors. Only hundreds of generations of
nobility marrying other nobility can create a perfect brain.</p>
<p>Obviously, this causes a few issues: nobles are generally wealthy and
powerful and don’t take kindly to the idea of being harvested. This
Gourmet has made a lot of powerful enemies, enemies that can hire the
best investigators, protections and adventurers available.</p>
<p>The main upside is that, over time, this Gourmet has accumulated a
fabulous wealth, from all the nobles it has feasted upon and its wallet
is as deep as that of its enemies.</p>
<h4 id="allies-3">Allies</h4>
<p>A few uniquely ruthless or vengeful nobles work for it, and many more
are manipulated into helping it without realizing it.</p>
<p>This mind flayer has its tentacles in every rebellion, assassin’s
guild, revolutionary movement and family feud in the world, looking for
every opportunity to snatch a crowned head when they are at their
weakest.</p>
<p>For its personal guard, it is careful to employ creatures that can
not easily be bought or bribed: golems and other constructs, undead,
madmen and monsters with no interest for money.</p>
<h4 id="lair-3">Lair</h4>
<p>A grand mausoleum, it’s a display of incredible, disgusting wealth,
an ode to nobility, a monument to blue blood: paintings and busts of
long-dead nobles cover the walls, with family trees of bloodlines nobody
else remembers.</p>
<p>Everything is marble, gold, ebony wood, jade, ceramic and every other
material that any culture ever associated with nobility.</p>
<p>In turn, it is guarded by creatures that have no interest in wealth,
and look very out of place in it: monsters, beasts, gibbering mutants,
undead, demons and more roam its fountain-riddled halls and flowery
gardens.</p>
<h4 id="plot-hooks-3">Plot Hooks</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Duke's son has disappeared, just a few hours before his
marriage. As the dukedom is sent into a frenzy, the scandal is serious
enough it could cause a war with the family of the scorned bride, and
nobody but the players seems to have the time to find the disappeared.
Most believe he simply chickened out.</li>
<li>The king died, and the funerals are in just a few days, but the body
has been stolen! Who committed such a disgusting and blasphemous act?
The players are tasked to discretely bring it back before the ceremony,
to avoid a scandal.</li>
<li>A revolution is sweeping the country, and it’s hunting season for
aristocrats. Some are simply eliminated by angry mobs, but a large
number of them seems to disappear. Both the surviving aristocrats in
hiding and the revolutionaries want to know what’s happening, are they
hiding? Have they escaped?</li>
<li>The players are tasked with escorting a noble during a trip. It
should be easy, but endless bandits attack them on the road, and they
seem a lot more vicious than normal.</li>
<li>The Grand Winter Ball is the most exclusive party of the year, and
it goes terribly wrong when the villa is attacked and everybody is taken
hostage. The attackers seem ready to leave, to carry the noble prisoners
away, nobody knows where.</li>
<li>The royal castle, one day, disappeared. Just like that. Some say
they saw a sorcerer put it inside a bottle and walk away.</li>
<li>One of the players is made a noble, as a reward. It doesn’t take
long before the attempts to kidnap them begin.</li>
<li>The ancient elven queen has been kidnapped, in a large-scale assault
at her castle. The devastation is untold, and the repercussions of
losing her unimaginable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trail leads them to a strange mausoleum.</p>
<h4 id="combat-3">Combat</h4>
<p>This Gourmet despises fighting, an activity for peasants. It will
hide behind its servants, and try to bribe the players if cornered. It
doesn’t have special powers, but it has a vast knowledge of military
tactics.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions-3">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>Once every hour, it can summon a Huge Animated Object made entirely
of Marble and Gold with an action. It lasts for 5 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="the-gourmet-of-bonds">The Gourmet of Bonds</h3>
<p>Also known as The Pairs Gourmet or The Chef of Lovers, this mind
flayer always eats brains in groups. It believes that no single mind can
achieve what a group can, and bonding with other people can produce
sensations impossible for a singular brain.</p>
<p>The bond between two lovers, twins, a master and apprentice, a parent
and child, these connections create something more, a spark that gives
the brain a uniquely spicy taste.</p>
<p>One of the vilest Gourmet, it is also the one with the fewer enemies
and that risks the less: its targets are often regular people from
villages and towns since it cares nothing for class or power.</p>
<p>It especially likes to target artists, romantic poets and bards, or
people with tormented relationships. To it, a couple of star-crossed
lovers is much more interesting than a stable couple married without any
drama.</p>
<h4 id="allies-4">Allies</h4>
<p>Regular bandits, people willing to kidnap their neighbours for money,
hunters and trappers that can ambush a travelling couple, jailers ready
to make someone visiting a parent disappear, the allies of this Gourmet
are as varied as its targets.</p>
<p>One peculiar element is its interest for the arts: this mind flayer
likes plays, paintings and books, even outside its need to eat, and
secretly supports many artists it finds interesting.</p>
<p>It especially likes romantic or dramatic stories.</p>
<h4 id="lair-4">Lair</h4>
<p>A beautiful garden island in an underground lake, where the light of
glowing flowers and fungi makes it look like it’s always twilight.</p>
<p>The island is filled with delicate flowers and fluffy animals, the
waters are tranquil and covered in water lilies and lotus flowers, and
the air smells of peaches, wisteria, violet and lavender.</p>
<p>It’s an incredibly romantic place, and often the Gourmet captures
people and leaves them on the island, just to see them enjoy their time
and develop a connection, as they spend time in what appears to be a
paradise. Food is abundant and the water fresh.</p>
<p>When the Gourmet gets tired of the island current guests, they get
eaten and new ones are brought in. The house of the Illithid is well
hidden on the island, and it knows plenty of magic to be able to spy on
its prisoners.</p>
<p>In case of emergency, strange creatures hide in the depths of the
lake and can rise to the surface to protect their master, the
Illithid.</p>
<h4 id="plot-hooks-4">Plot Hooks:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Two families have been enemies for a long time until two kids from
the two families fell in love with each other. Eventually, they
convinced their parents of the power of their love, and marriage was
allowed. The union could have healed the two families, but both lovers
disappeared the night before the marriage. Each family accuses the
other, the tension is palpable, and if the players don’t find the two,
it will be a bloodbath.</li>
<li>The Pauls brothers are well-known merchants, and have grown their
family wealth a hundredfold in just a few years. One day, they both
disappeared.s</li>
<li>The old Knight Joshua had retired, after many years of service. He
had always refused to take apprentices, until a year ago, when a young
girl from the countryside, somehow, convinced him to train her. She
showed great promise, but one day they both disappeared. They said
nothing to nobody, and food was found still on their table, still warm,
as if they’d gone away in the middle of dinner.</li>
<li>The village priestess was training her replacement, they were both
meditating in a chapel on the cliffs when it was attacked by bandits and
they were both kidnapped.</li>
<li>The players wake up and found the inn empty. The owners have
disappeared, the whole family seems gone.</li>
<li>A paladin and a Warlock were travelling around together. Despite
being an odd pair, they’d become quite famous throughout the land for
their deeds. They seem to have vanished, leaving many questions
unanswered.</li>
<li>A painter NPC friend of the players disappears for a while, then he
comes back. He’s very elusive about where he went and seems to have
found newfound inspiration. His paintings are of a beautiful garden with
strange, alien light. The players also notice now he owns a bunch of
gold and some magical trinkets. He won’t talk about their origin.</li>
<li>An NPC that is very important for one of the players is kidnapped,
and a trail of clues is left for them to follow.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="combat-4">Combat</h4>
<p>This Illithid isn’t a fighter, and relies on its servants, or trying
to wriggle its way out with its high charisma.</p>
<p>If forced, it employs powerful poisons and traps.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions-4">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>Once per encounter, it can create an effect equivalent to the 7th
level spell Prismatic Spray, but it hits every sentient creature in a
300ft radius.</p>
<h3 id="the-gourmet-of-saints">The Gourmet of Saints</h3>
<p>Also known as The Pious Gourmet, or The Holy Chef, this mind flayer
only eats holy brains, priests and bishops, saints and paladins.</p>
<p>It is a strange Mind Flayer: it considers itself a righteous and good
person, and respects religion, or at least says it does. It doesn’t see
eating brains as a bad thing, but as a way to embrace holiness, a
wholesome act of faith that will bring it closer to the Gods and cleanse
its sins.</p>
<p>It’s not clear if this is a part it plays, in a sort of twisted and
sadistic play, or it really believes it.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, this Mind Flayer dresses in bishop robes, speaks
in sermons and parables, punishes its minions when they “sin” and seems
really committed to the part.</p>
<p>Its choices of targets mean that countless inquisitors, crusaders and
clerics are hunting for it.</p>
<h4 id="allies-5">Allies</h4>
<p>The bizarre attitude of this Mind Flayer makes working for it hard:
there are cultists, satanists, diabolists and other people with a gripe
against organised religions. They help it willingly, but still fear and
dislike it.</p>
<p>There is a peculiar sect that believes this Mind Flayer to be a holy
creature and religiously follow it. They are its personal guard and most
dedicated followers, all dangerous fanatics with a loose grip on
reality.</p>
<h4 id="lair-5">Lair</h4>
<p>A profaned cathedral somewhere in Gehenna. The building is
impressive, large and richly decorated, with statues and paintings
belonging to multiple religions. Around the Cathedral are a walled
garden and a monastery, where the followers of the Illithid live.</p>
<p>The place is effectively a fortress and contains a fortune in
decorations, relics and long-lost religious tomes.</p>
<h4 id="plot-hooks-5">Plot Hooks</h4>
<ul>
<li>The village is sent in disarray when their only preacher is grabbed
and carried away in the middle of a ceremony.</li>
<li>The church has been overwhelmed by the undead, what happened? Where
did all the clerics go?</li>
<li>The players were tasked to bring a message to an isolated monastery,
but find it empty, there are signs of a struggle, but no bodies are
present. The traces aren’t very old.</li>
<li>Many bishops have disappeared, and the bishop of the city the
players are in fears he’ll be next. He wants to hire bodyguards.</li>
<li>A paladin order was sent to fight a demonic cult, but in the middle
of the fight, a third group arrived and started kidnapping the paladin
leaders. The order is now weakened, the remaining soldiers under siege
by demons, isolated and scared. The players are sent to save them and
find out what happened.</li>
<li>The players are contacted by a small group of witch hunters and
paladins that want their help for a very secretive and dangerous
mission.</li>
<li>An angel was attacked and dragged away in chains, towards a noxious
portal.</li>
<li>The players are sent to find a holy relic. It disappeared two
centuries ago, together with a Supreme Inquisitor. Some voices say the
Inquisitor was recently spotted, alive, wearing blasphemous insignia and
leading members of a weird cult that were kidnapping clerics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="combat-5">Combat</h4>
<p>After the players have gone through the army of blasphemous believers
that fill the monastery, clad in white and golden robes, they will face
the Pious Gourmet in its cathedral.</p>
<p>This will unleash abominations against them, while it rants and raves
about sin and justice. It fights with a cat o' nine tails and is
extremely resilient.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions-5">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>When wounded, once per round, it can set its own blood on fire. The
next attack that hits it will cause a spray of fire that deals 6d6
damage to whoever landed the hit.</p>
<h3 id="the-gourmet-of-sages">The Gourmet of Sages</h3>
<p>Also known as The Wizened Chef, The Wise One or The Old Squid, this
old Illithid only eats brains of smart and wise people, people with
decades, centuries of experience, that have put their brain to good
use.</p>
<p>It prefers victims with a longer lifespan: elves, dragons etc.</p>
<p>Its favourite food, if extremely rare, is Aboleths.</p>
<p>Often, the people it eats are loners, or near the end of their
natural life, so their disappearance doesn’t cause big investigations or
even much grief.</p>
<p>There is the occasional mage or important elder, but power isn’t the
main factor when looking for prey.</p>
<p>Still, a number of dragons, Aboleths, wizarding schools and elven
enclaves actively hunt this Mind Flayer.</p>
<h4 id="allies-6">Allies</h4>
<p>Instead of relying on strangers and mercenaries, this Gourmet has
created its own school. A mixture between a school of magic and a
monastery, it encourages the study of all disciplines of the mind,
sciences, and history. The school is quite large, and it’s well known
for its rigorous discipline.</p>
<p>Most of the students have no idea who’s the real leader of the
school, only a select few are initiated to the school hidden side.</p>
<p>Teachers and students that show talent, but not enough to be a danger
for the Gourmet, and a lack of morals, are given special positions and
powers, eliminate other students when they snoop around and sent on a
mission to capture meals for their master.</p>
<p>In rare occasions, students or teachers of the school itself are
eaten, but the Gourmet avoids it as much as possible, to not attract
attention.</p>
<p>The Illithid is a magic user, a rare thing for Mind Flayers, but it
is not an alhoon: undeath could ruin its taste for brains, and it has no
interest in taking such a risk.</p>
<h4 id="lair-6">Lair</h4>
<p>Part school, part monastery, the hundreds of students, guards,
teachers and servants form a natural defence against heroes, especially
since the majority of the presents are innocent and have no knowledge of
their hidden master.</p>
<p>Inside the school is an elaborate labyrinth of crawlspaces, false
walls and hidden rooms that leads to a central tower, impossible to
reach by accident. It is protected by glyphs, seals, golems and the most
trusted servants of the Gourmet.</p>
<p>The tower itself is a laboratory, prison and kitchen where the Mind
Flayer spends almost all of its time. It has magical mirrors that can
spy most of the school.</p>
<h4 id="plot-hooks-6">Plot Hooks:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Old Priest Viljam has been a wise guide for both the village and the
players, giving them quests and aid. When the players get back to him to
report a mission accomplished, they find his house trashed and he
disappeared.</li>
<li>A group of mages has attacked the king vizier, kidnapping him, and
burning down half the castle in the process.</li>
<li>The players are hunting an evil monk when a strange, sketchy wizard
contacts them and offers them a massive sum to capture him alive. No
questions asked.</li>
<li>The old elven queen is considered one of the wisest and experienced
mortals around, but recently she’s been attacked multiple times by
mysterious and dangerous enchanters. The queen can’t trust her own
security, some of the guards appear to have been charmed or controlled,
and wants to hire trusted outsiders to protect her and eliminate the
threat.</li>
<li>A long procession of mages and monks walked into the ocean a couple
of days ago, apparently trying to reach some nearby cave. Nobody has any
idea where it leads, and they haven’t come back since. The earth has
trembled regularly for the last couple of days.</li>
<li>A terrible accident happened at a nearby school for wizards. Many
people died, something tried to escape from inside the school. The
school is trying its best to cover it up. Concerned parents hire the
players to investigate and protect their kids.</li>
<li>The players meet a young woman. She is an adventurer of some
experience and has been travelling the world for a long time, looking
for the monster that kidnapped her grandfather, many years ago. Her only
trail leads to... a school?</li>
<li>One of the players is a monk or wizard, and this is the school they
went to. They are asked to get back when one of their old friends
disappears inside the school.</li>
</ul>
<p>They were investigating something about the building, but nobody
knows exactly what. Strange rumours are going around.</p>
<h4 id="combat-6">Combat</h4>
<p>The Mind Flayer is as wise as it is powerful, with plenty of spells.
If the players challenge it in its tower, it will also have traps,
protections and imprisoned experiments to set against them. They really
should find a way to force it out, if they want a fair fight.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions-6">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>With a movement action, it can throw to the ground a bunch of potions
and beakers, creating a Black Pudding and a toxic 20ft radius cloud that
deals 4d6 acid to any creature that ends its turn in it.</p>
<h3 id="the-gourmet-of-aliens">The Gourmet of Aliens</h3>
<p>Also known as The Mad Chef, The Far Cook or The Blind Gourmet, this
mind flayer eats brains wracked by insanity, touched by the gibbering,
tentacular horrors from the Far Realm. Sometimes, when possible, it eats
the horrors themselves.</p>
<p>This Gourmet spends a lot of time between tomes of forbidden
knowledge and gibbering prophets of the unspeakable entities from beyond
reality, when it’s not busy feasting on their alien-touched brains, and
as a result, it’s quite unstable itself.</p>
<p>Its targets, by their very nature, are hard to find and harder to
capture, so this Mind Flayer has two strategies: hiding its identity, it
supports and finances archaeological expeditions, researchers and
investigators that appear to be dabbling in this exoteric knowledge or
that have gotten involved with alien matters, but it also supports and
hides cultists, when possible.</p>
<p>It wants the cults to push their rituals as far as possible, to bring
abominable things into this world or go insane trying, and to know when
and where this happens.</p>
<p>It keeps an eye on black markets, powerful alienists and collectors
of eldritch items, trying to form a bond with them, when possible, and
follow their movements.</p>
<p>One peculiar enemy of this Gourmet is the mysterious Mind Flayers of
Thoon, a group of mad Illithids that worship a poorly understood entity.
They are a favourite dinner of this Gourmet, but catching them alive is
as dangerous as it is difficult.</p>
<h4 id="allies-7">Allies</h4>
<p>Few and far between. The type of people this gourmet is interested in
are rarely social people, often complete outcasts, criminals or deranged
that keep to themselves and others of their kind.</p>
<p>The only real allies of this Gourmet are a few selected cultists, but
such an alliance of madmen is unstable and rarely lasts long. The people
that know they are working for it are all missing a few marbles, when
they’re not simply gibbering monsters and abominations.</p>
<h4 id="lair-7">Lair</h4>
<p>A crooked house on the edge of the Far Realm. The house regularly
changes location and appears quite small and fragile on the outside.</p>
<p>Inside, it’s filled with maze-like corridors, rooms of impossible
geometry, libraries containing lost knowledge and forbidden tomes that
will burn your mind and body as you read them, sacrificial rooms and
laboratories.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you can meet bottomless pits and endless lakes hiding
unnamed horrors, forests and deserts, graveyards and entire cities, as
reality itself twists and cracks.</p>
<p>Everything is possible.</p>
<p>The place is protected by its own nightmarish, maze-like nature, and
will drive mad most intruders. If that’s not enough, a plethora of
abominations shuffles and chitter in its halls.</p>
<h4 id="plot-hooks-7">Plot Hooks</h4>
<ul>
<li>A group of cultists suddenly ramp up their operation, after
receiving a large donation from an unnamed benefactor.</li>
<li>A group of cultists is sent into chaos when their leader disappears.
The ritual is out of control, spawning one monster after the other.</li>
<li>An archaeological expedition recently found some bizarre pieces in a
strange temple. Nobody should even know about them yet, but an enormous
offer has already arrived from a buyer.</li>
<li>A lord had a creepy book in his collection, nobody had ever even
managed to open it, and nobody knew its origin. It was recently stolen,
and aberrations started appearing in the countryside only a few days
later.</li>
<li>Some ritual is being performed, sending waves of pure chaos over the
land, twisting reality and changing everything into a nightmarish
version of itself. One private investigator received a tip on how to
reach and stop the cult from an anonymous source.</li>
<li>The players find the temple of an eldritch cult, worshipping some
elder god, and it’s empty. There are signs of a fight, but every cultist
has disappeared and all of their scrolls, items and prisoners were taken
with them.</li>
<li>The players are contacted by a wealthy nobleman, asking them to
explore an ancient underground complex. It seems some abomination is
trapped in it, and the nobleman wants it. Alive.</li>
<li>The house appears in front of the players.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="combat-7">Combat</h4>
<p>This Mind flayer is unstable, its psychic powers are powerful and
explosive, often acting unpredictably. It’s a dangerous and strange
enemy to fight.</p>
<p>It is blind, and physically it appears thin and frail, but do not be
misled: it is able to withstand any punishment.</p>
