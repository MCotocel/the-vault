<h1 id="gambits">Gambits</h1>
<h2 id="tactical-gambits">Tactical Gambits</h2>
<p>The tactical gambit rules presented here are opt-in mechanical layer
on top of normal 5e combat rules that allow players and foes to attempt
heroic manoeuvres typically depicted in fiction.</p>
<p>The design prerogative of these options is to not change the balance
of the game; and they are not meant to replace or invalidate any core
rules like fighting styles, feats, existing combat actions, or classes
like the battle master and their manoeuvres.</p>
<p>Semantically a gambit is <em>when someone sacrifices a resource or an
opportunity in order to achieve a potential upper hand in a
conflict</em>. The gambits presented here allow a player to trade
advantage or to take disadvantage on their attack roll for potential
tactical benefits. This means that gambit benefits are curbed by the
choice of taking a gamble. Thus both a player that actively embraces
gambits, and a player that prefers to play it safe will be roughly equal
in combat.</p>
<h3 id="using-tactical-gambits">Using Tactical Gambits</h3>
<p>Once per turn, when you do not already have disadvantage on an
attack, you can choose to perform a gambit while performing an attack by
taking disadvantage to the attack. If you had advantage on the attack
the gambit counters your advantage and you roll normally.</p>
<p>On a successful hit, in addition to the normal damage of your attack
you can apply the benefits of the gambit you chose.</p>
<p>Additionally, as an optional rule, you may trade extra damage dice on
a successful critical hit to use a gambit, however you must decide to do
so before you roll any damage dice.</p>
<h2 id="aimed-shot">Aimed shot</h2>
<p><em>Range attacks only.</em> You take the time to aim extra carefully
before shooting. You can ignore up to three-quarters cover on the
attack. However because of your focus you cannot take attacks of
opportunity until the start of your next turn.</p>
<h2 id="arm-injury">Arm Injury</h2>
<p>On a successful hit you slightly injure the target's arm, or an
equivalent appendage. The target has disadvantage on the next weapon
attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.</p>
<h2 id="bash-shield">Bash Shield</h2>
<p>On a successful hit you push aside the target's shield. The target
cannot benefit from the protection of their shield until the start of
its next turn.</p>
<h2 id="careful-attack">Careful Attack</h2>
<p><em>Melee attacks only.</em> You attack very carefully. The next
attack against you has disadvantage until the start of your next
turn.</p>
<h2 id="dig-the-wound">Dig the wound</h2>
<p>If the target is already missing any of its hit points before your
attack, you can aim for a weak point in it's defences, roll a d4 and add
it to the damage.</p>
<h2 id="disorient">Disorient</h2>
<p>On a successful hit you disorient the target, and it moves 5 feet in
a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll
a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This
movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction
rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.</p>
<h2 id="distract">Distract</h2>
<p>The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you
has advantage if the attack is made before the start of the target's
next turn.</p>
<h2 id="flat-of-the-blade">Flat of the Blade</h2>
<p><em>Melee attacks only.</em> You adjust your combat style to change
the damage type of your weapon. You can choose to change the damage of
your attack to bludgeoning, piercing or slashing.</p>
<h2 id="hamstring">Hamstring</h2>
<p>On a successful hit the target begins limping. It must spend an
additional foot for every foot it moves until the end of its next
turn.</p>
<h2 id="head-hit-or-gut-punch">Head hit, or Gut punch</h2>
<p>On a successful hit the target can't take reactions until the start
of its next turn.</p>
<h2 id="reckless-lunge">Reckless Lunge</h2>
<p><em>Melee attacks only</em> You increase the reach of your attack by
5 feet before the attack.</p>
<h2 id="mock-or-trick">Mock, or Trick</h2>
<p><em>Requires Charisma 13 or higher.</em> On a successful hit the
target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes against you, as
well as any Wisdom checks it performs before the end of its next
turn.</p>
<h2 id="pin-down">Pin Down</h2>
<p>After a successful hit against the target you can use a bonus action
to pin the target to the ground, a wall, or another large object. A
pinned creature is considered grappled by the object it is pinned to
until it uses an action, or bonus action to free it's self, or the end
of its next turn when it automatically breaks free.</p>
<h2 id="pot-shots">Pot shots</h2>
<p><em>Range attacks only.</em> You aim carelessly for easy shots on
nearby targets. After your attack you can use your bonus action to
perform a second attack on a separate target, this second attack also
suffers disadvantage. Both attacks must be performed on targets within
10-feet of you.</p>
<h2 id="push">Push</h2>
<p><em>Melee attacks only.</em> On a successful hit you can push a
target, that is of your size or smaller, 5-feet back while pursuing the
target 5-feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if
the direction is blocked, you and the target don't move.</p>
<h2 id="pull-or-lure">Pull, or Lure</h2>
<p><em>Melee attacks only.</em> On a successful hit you can move 5-feet
away from the target and pull the same target, if it is of your size or
smaller, 5-feet towards you. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity
attacks, and if the direction is blocked, you and the target don't
move.</p>
<h2 id="ricochet">Ricochet</h2>
<p><em>Range attacks only.</em> You aim for a ricochet hit in an attempt
to catch the target off guard. When performing a ricochet, you need line
of sight to a surface or object that has line of sight to the target.
When you perform a ricochet attack you ignore half cover and any shield
bonus to AC the target might have.</p>
<h2 id="tricky-pass">Tricky Pass</h2>
<p><em>Melee attacks only.</em> When performing an attack of opportunity
against a moving target you can perform a pass. On a successful hit you
force the target to spend it's movement to move 5-feet in any direction
of your choice. This forced movement doesn't provoke opportunity
attacks.</p>
<h2 id="unbalance">Unbalance</h2>
<p>After a successful hit against the target loses their balance. The
target has disadvantage on checks, and saves to avoid being moved or
forced prone until the start of it's next turn.</p>
