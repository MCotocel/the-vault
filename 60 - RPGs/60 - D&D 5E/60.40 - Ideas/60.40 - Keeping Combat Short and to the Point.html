<h1 id="keeping-combat-short-and-to-the-point">Keeping Combat Short and
to the Point</h1>
<h2 id="not-a-combat-faq">Not-a-combat-FAQ</h2>
<p>This is not really meant to be an FAQ for combat. However, something
has struck me in answering questions from new DMs, and that's really the
inspiration for this whole semi-organized post.</p>
<p>Some common questions from new DMs regarding combat include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do I make combat interesting?</li>
<li>My players are bored with combat, what do I do?</li>
<li>Combat seems pointless, what do I do?</li>
<li>Is this encounter balanced for a party of level X?</li>
<li>What if I kill my party?</li>
<li>Help! I want to run a huge battle, how do I do this?</li>
</ul>
<p>I often find that the way I answer these questions converges on a
singular solution: keep combat short, but interesting.</p>
<p>The two big things that I keep in mind to help me keep things
interesting are: (#1) identify the purpose of the combat and (#2) do NOT
let combat drag on. Because I'm talking about combat, I'll also add a
few thoughts about the reasons why I say
to-hell-with-worrying-too-much-about-balance and how I run large-scale
battles.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-fighting-for">What are we fighting for?</h2>
<p>When prepping an encounter for an adventure, I think about the
following questions. Even if it's an improvised or random wandering
monster-type encounter, I think about these questions for at least a
moment before starting the fight:</p>
<h3
id="why-would-the-monsters-fight-the-pcs-why-would-the-pcs-fight-the-monsters">Why
would the monsters fight the PCs? Why would the PCs fight the
monsters?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is there antipathy between the monsters and the PCs?</li>
<li>Are the monsters known to be members of a rival faction?</li>
<li>Are the monsters hungry?</li>
<li>Are the PCs slightly evil?</li>
<li>Are the PCs or the monsters bent on self-destruction?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-the-monsters-doing-when-the-pcs-encounter-them">What
are the monsters doing when the PCs encounter them?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The giant spider is repairing her web after a storm.</li>
<li>The giant spider is hunting for small game.</li>
<li>The giant spider is sleeping after a big meal.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="what-would-the-monsters-be-doing-if-the-pcs-never-showed-up">What
would the monsters be doing if the PCs never showed up?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The giant spider would be going about her business, not looking for
food because she ate recently.</li>
<li>The giant spider would be tucking in to drain the juices from that
halfling she caught yesterday.</li>
</ul>
<h3
id="what-would-the-pcs-be-doing-if-they-didnt-run-into-the-monsters">What
would the PCs be doing if they didn't run into the monsters?</h3>
<ul>
<li>If mission objective X [such as escort Bob the NPC from point A to
point B] is more important than killing a random giant spider, the PCs
may just avoid the spider rather than try to kill her.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that I have established some purposes for the fight (if a fight
even occurs), it will be easier to make the fight a part of the story
rather than an interruption to the story.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-battle-lost-or-won">Is the battle lost or won?</h2>
<p>After each round, ask:</p>
<p>Is one side badly beaten?</p>
<ul>
<li>If YES, then end combat.</li>
<li>If NO, then run another round of combat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some may ask, how do I end combat if there are combatants that are
still above 0 hp? To which I respond with another question, how do most
fights end? In most animals - dogs, mountain goats, grizzly bears,
elephant seals, even humans - , instances of aggression only rarely end
with the death of an individual. Most of the time, one individual slinks
away when it is badly beaten or it submits to the other. Many monsters
and enemies will behave the same way. Fighting is dangerous. Any
individual interested in surviving is more likely to run away than go
toe-to-toe with someone or something that is clearly better equipped for
violence.</p>
<p>So I try to think about potential outcomes other than death:</p>
<h3 id="flight-and-pursuit">Flight and pursuit</h3>
<p>What are the immediate consequences if the remaining monsters/PCs
fleeing? Can the monsters or PCs actually escape or are they trapped or
do they run into something else?</p>
<h3 id="surrender-and-captives">Surrender and captives</h3>
<p>What do the monsters/PCs do with foes that surrender? How does the
action wrap up? What are some of the PCs next possible actions? Can they
sell information or treasure for their freedom? Can the PCs afford to
leave the monsters alive? What are the consequences of releasing or
killing the prisoners?</p>
<h3 id="to-the-death">To the death</h3>
<p>How does the action wrap up if the monsters/PCs want to fight to the
death in a hopeless situation? Even if the last two of a dozen gnolls
keep fighting, you don't have to roll the last few rounds it takes to
finish them off. Just tell the PCs: You corner the last two gnolls. They
are still snarling and slashing at you, despite being outnumbered and
outclassed. How do you want to finish them off? Let them describe the
action without rolling dice then move on with the adventure.</p>
<h3 id="shaking-things-up">Shaking things up</h3>
<p>If the PCs and the monsters are pretty evenly matched after
<sub>3</sub> rounds, I will think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will the monsters flee anyways for the sake of self-preservation?
They won't surrender if they are not definitively losing, but they might
run. The goblins, not interested in a tough fight, hightail it down a
passage to your left.</li>
<li>How can I shake things up with the arrival of more enemies or an
ally or two? This might tip the scales of the battle. The guards from
north watchtower race down the steps to join their comrades defending
the gate.</li>
<li>How can I shake things up with the arrival of a large predator, a
weather or terrain hazard, or third fighting force that threatens both
the PCs and the monsters. Several of the lizardfolk warriors scamper
into the copse of mangroves as a hydra erupts from the swamp water
before you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is to transform the fight. The fight goes from what might
have turned into a many-round slugfest into something else entirely. I
don't do this every time the sides are evenly matched after a few
rounds, but I do it frequently, and as long as you don't use the same
type of shake-up, the players aren't likely to catch on that you hadn't
planned it that way from the beginning. Then I let the battle continue
for another round or two and ask the question again, Is one side badly
beaten?</p>
<p>Basically, I keep combat interesting by understanding its place in
the ongoing story and by keeping it brief. I typically only let it go on
for 2-3 rounds (sometimes only 1 round, occasionally more for important
villains), and then we are back to the story (which might include
quickly moving on to the next combat against different monsters in a
different location).</p>
<h2
id="how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-about-balance-and-love-the-battle">How
I learned to stop worrying about balance and love the battle</h2>
<p>By keeping combat encounters short as I've outlined above, I
generally don't have to worry about balance for a number of reasons:</p>
<h3 id="interesting-story-outcomes">Interesting story outcomes</h3>
<p>There are many outcomes of combat other than death, and many of these
outcomes are opportunities to build your world and to develop stories
around NPCs and monsters. If you spent a little time thinking about why
a fight is happening, you'll have some thought as to what happens if one
side flees or surrenders.</p>
<h3 id="its-okay-to-kill-pcs">It's okay to kill PCs</h3>
<p>If the PCs are severely overmatched, I don't sweat it. I end combat
some way other than death (flight, surrender, etc.). Sometimes, one or
more PCs will die. It's ok to kill PCs, especially if they are being
stupid. The key is that you make character death part of the story. PC
deaths can be heroic, tragic, or absurd and hilarious. I would not
recommend always killing PCs, but when it happens, make it fun. And
always highlight to the player that a death means they have an
opportunity to step into a new role. I often ask that my players keep a
second PC ready-to-go at party level or one level lower, so the
understudy can step up in the event of a death. This saves a lot of time
if a PC death happens early in a session.</p>
<h3 id="its-okay-for-the-players-to-feel-like-super-heroes">It's okay
for the players to feel like super-heroes</h3>
<p>If the monsters are severely overmatched, I don't sweat it, but I try
to use tougher monsters or more monsters next time. If the PCs cut
through the enemies much more quickly and easily than I expected, it
helps the players feel like their PCs are awesome and powerful. I would
not recommend always having encounters that are too easy, but when it
happens, make it fun. Let the players narrate how they finish off the
stragglers. Make the monsters run away and see what the PCs do. (Do the
PCs charge after the fleeing goblins recklessly? There might be
something else out there...)</p>
<p>When I figured this out, I felt incredibly stupid for the hours and
days I had spent labouring over stat blocks and numbers in preparing for
sessions. I can't get those hours and days back, but maybe I can save
you some of the trouble. Don't be stupid and think an adult green dragon
won't kill a party of level 2 PCs (it will), but you can get creative
with how a party of level 2 PCs might interact with one, and you can
kill one stupid PC to put the fear of the gods into the players. If your
campaign world is dangerous and frightening, show them how frightening
it can be.</p>
<h2 id="large-scale-battles-make-them-smaller">Large-scale battles: Make
them smaller</h2>
<p>If you are planning a massive siege or meeting of two armies, you
could run an entire session as a single epic battle. But I would not run
it is a never-ending series of turns and moves and attacks and whatnot,
nor would I include every single combatant. Let me repeat that: I do NOT
include every single combatant in a large battle. I only run the
combatants with whom the PCs directly interact. Running every combatant
will slow things down way too much. It will become boring for the
players while you the DM roll several dozen times attack rolls and
damage rolls. When I first started DMing I would run battles with a
dozen monsters, a half-dozen allied NPCs, and the PCs, and it was
horrible.</p>
<p>So what I do to make this work, keep things moving, and capture the
feel of a large-scale battle? I run large-scale battles as lots of short
encounters with many other battle-related tasks happening in between. A
battle in the story may involve hundreds or thousands of critters or
warriors, but the mechanical dice-rolling is kept to only a handful of
enemies against the PCs. Additionally, I keep the narration fun by using
flavorful mooks and minions to make a fight with a dozen thieves,
soldiers, or cultists feel like you are fighting individuals instead of
a mob of matching Stormtroopers.</p>
<p>Some tasks PCs might perform in an epic battle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic decisions for commanding troop positioning and
movements.</li>
<li>Rescuing an ally who is surrounded.</li>
<li>Running across the field to reinforce a redoubt.</li>
<li>Finding planks and furniture to reinforce a gate or door.</li>
<li>Scraping together some parts to repair a huge catapult.</li>
<li>Quickly digging a trench or erecting a barricade.</li>
<li>Burning a bridge or blasting a tunnel to seal it off.</li>
<li>Choosing to do one of these tasks at the expense of doing
another.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'd set up a scoreboard or tracker that would reflect how the battle
is going for the different factions until you reach the final tipping
point confrontation. I wouldn't necessarily show the score to the PCs,
but in narration, I'd make it clear which side is doing well and which
side is doing poorly. Finally, thinking back to the purpose of the
battle, I'd think about one or more other conditions for victory or
specific events that mark one side has won or lost. These are things
that happen automatically when the battle ends OR that end the battle
when they happen.</p>
<p>Here's are some specifics on how I do this:</p>
<p>### Battle tracker</p>
<p>A simple battle tracker starts at 0 and moves in 1-2 point increments
as the PCs complete tasks, win short combat encounters, or fail at
them.</p>
<p>### Victory conditions</p>
<p>The "good guys" win the grand battle when the tracker reaches +10 and
the "bad guys" win the grand battle when the tracker reaches -10.
Winning might mean surrender or it might mean one side's forces break
and flee.</p>
<p>### Events and outcomes</p>
<p>What happens when the battle is lost or won? How might the battle be
lost or won in a single act? This could include the death of a commander
or breaching an inner chamber. One of these events may happen when the
tracker reaches +10 or -10, or it may happen irrespective of the tracker
if it makes sense based on the PCs' decisions.</p>
<p>### Combat encounters</p>
<p>If the PCs smash their way through a short combat encounter quickly,
the tracker might get +1 or +2. If the PCs struggle through a short
combat encounter, the tracker might get -1 or -2. If the PCs decide to
perform a command- or strategy-related task, the tracker moves based on
how well.</p>
<p>### Other tasks</p>
<p>If the PCs attempt to hastily build a barricade, but roll poorly on
strength and carpentry checks to do the building, the tracker might get
-2 (lost time and a poor barricade). If the PCs are successful in
building a barricade, but it takes a long time, the tracker might get +0
(a good barricade, but lost ground elsewhere). If PCs can get the
barricade built quickly and well, the tracker might get +2.</p>
<p>### Other combatants</p>
<p>I will often roll a d20 once during the enemy combatants' turn - or
whenever the PCs are performing a battle-related non-combat task - to
determine how the rest of the battle is going. On a result of 16-20, the
tracker gets +1; on a result of 1-5, the tracker gets -1. I might modify
this roll based on how well the PCs are doing in combat or on the task.
It's all a little arbitrary, but the point is, if the roll comes up low,
I describe the PCs witnessing the enemy advancing or slaughtering an
ally, or if the roll comes up high, I describe the PCs witnessing their
allies doing well. This preserves the feel of a large-scale battle, but
since the tracker is much more modified by what the PCs do than by the
occasional d20 roll, they will feel like their contributions or failures
are what turn the tide of the battle.</p>
