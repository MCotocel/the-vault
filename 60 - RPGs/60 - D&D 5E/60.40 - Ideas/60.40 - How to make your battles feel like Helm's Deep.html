<h1 id="how-to-make-your-battles-feel-like-helms-deep">How to make your
battles feel like Helm's Deep</h1>
<h2 id="what-youll-need">What You'll Need:</h2>
<p>In order to make this work you still need full stat blocks for all
kinds of enemy creatures in the opposing army. I ran it with stats for
basic soldiers, special units like berserkers and scouts, and stat
blocks for a few high-profile targets like the leading general. You’ll
need a mental (and possibly visual) map of the area of engagement but
probably won’t need an actual battle map. It also helps to have notes on
what sort of siege weaponry each side has, if any. This can be useful
for descriptive flavor and opportunities for your players to do really
cool stuff.</p>
<h2 id="heroic-actions">Heroic Actions:</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the battle, each player roles a d4 and records
the number. If they want they can spend any inspiration dice they have
to add +1 to this number. This is the number of Heroic Actions they have
for this stage of the fight. Every time they do a Heroic Action they
will spend one of these. Once everyone runs out, they can re-roll.
Heroic Actions are sort of like legendary actions. They can be used at
any time during the battle, but can be more abstract than a normal
action. Try to encourage players to take turns, but let them decide the
best narrative order in which to spend their actions. Don’t enforce a
strict order. You can do 4 things with Heroic Actions. Fight, Move,
Cast, and Other.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fight: The player either wants to attack one high profile target, or
a bunch of normal targets. If they’re attacking a high profile target
just treat everything like normal. They roll against AC and roll for
damage, taking away some hp. However, if they’re attacking a unit (like
a soldier or berserker), have them roll 1d20 against the armour class of
that unit. If they succeed, don’t worry about damage. This is a
narrative success. They succeed at cutting a swath some ways into the
enemy forces, thinning the enemy ranks with arrows, or holding off the
swarms of orcs coming over the bridge.</li>
<li>Move: Sometimes positioning is more important than combat. So long
as a player can find an avenue to get around the monstrous hordes, they
should be able to move a long way. If they’re jumping across rooftops or
something have them make an acrobatics or athletics check, but overall
the players will be able to do much more interesting things if you let
them get around the battlefield easily.</li>
<li>Cast: BUFF SPELLS. Let them be more powerful than usual. Let players
cast two per heroic action. Still keep track of spell slots, still make
people roll spell attacks or saving throws, but let your spell-casters
blow some stuff up! Creative spell use can really shape the battlefield
and make things interesting. Just like in Fight, if spells are cast are
against units, treat a failed save on behalf of the unit or successful
spell attack roll on behalf of the caster as an overall success on
whatever they caster is trying to do. If it’s against a high profile
target use normal rules.</li>
<li>Other: Maybe this is a last minute rescue for a player about to
plummet off a wall and to their untimely doom. Maybe something else.
Make the player roll for a skill check, and if they pass they should
have a huge success.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consequences">Consequences:</h2>
<p>When your players aren’t taking Heroic Actions assume that they are
surviving. They’re exceptional heroes and should be able to hold their
ground in battle. They shouldn’t be advancing or making forward
progress, but they should be able to stay alive. If the good guys are
retreating, so will they. If the good guys are pushing forward already,
they can too. The only time a player should be enacting meaningful
change on the battlefield is through the use of Heroic Action. However,
acting heroically is a risky business, and should incur consequences,
such as unwanted attention from the enemy. At the end of a player’s
heroic action, you will have to make a judgement call and roll a dice
for how many attacks they incur from the opposing forces. These can be
thrown weapons, arrows, or melee attacks. It also doesn’t matter if
these attacks all come from one enemy or many. Whatever makes more
narrative sense. Here’s how to decide which die to roll.</p>
<ul>
<li>No Risk (0): The player drew no attention to themselves. This most
often happens during a Move action, or if they deliberately wanted to do
something stealthy. They’ll incur no attacks from this action.</li>
<li>Mild Risk (1d4): The player remained in a relatively safe position
or didn’t draw too much attention to themselves during their action.
This is a big battle, so there’s still a risk of incurring up to four
attacks from the enemy.</li>
<li>High Risk (1d6): The player pulled off something that draws the ire
of the enemy, or ended their action in a dangerous position. They risk
up to six attacks.</li>
<li>Huge Risk (1d8): The player did something to paint a target on
themselves or landed right in the middle of the fight. Hopefully
whatever they tried was worth it. They risk up to 8 attacks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-flow-of-battle">The Flow Of Battle:</h2>
<p>Lastly, a few notes on how this will actually run. The DM is
essentially telling a story where the players can interrupt at any time
in order to address new threats as they arise, or to act against the
enemy. The nature of the consequences listed above is that the fight
should wear the players down. As things carry on they WILL take hits and
they WILL run out of resources. To compensate for this, only create a
few high profile targets, who will act like boss fights during the
battle. The goal should pretty clearly be to reach and defeat these
targets, unless you want to try getting creative and set other goals.
The above consequences will compensate for the high profile targets
being at a disadvantage in terms of the action economy.</p>
<p>Decide what you're willing to let players accomplish during a Heroic
Action ahead of time, or at least have a vague idea. If a player wants
to do something that you think is too much for one action, work with
them to make it more reasonable. There is no "right amount" of things a
player can do on a Heroic Action, but once you decide what works for
your game, make sure you're consistent. As stated above, I found that
two spells (with exaggerated effects) per Cast action was a good amount.
Move actions aren't that exciting, so the most fun option for the
players is usually just to let them go wherever they want as long as
there's an open route. Fight actions are tricky, as they can range from
a good description of a player kicking ass, to players pushing through
enemy ranks towards the big bad. Use your best judgement, and negotiate
with the players when an action seems to big. I found that players were
usually satisfied with Fight actions so long as descriptions were cool,
even if they didn't always have a massive affect on the overall
fight.</p>
