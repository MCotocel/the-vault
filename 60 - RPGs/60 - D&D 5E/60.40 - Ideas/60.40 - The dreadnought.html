<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="the-dreadnought">The dreadnought</h1>
<p>First time posting here, but I just wanted to share a creature
concept I used on my party a while ago.</p>
<p>The idea was to create a Terminator style pursuit predator,
infallible and unflinching. Stats aren't super important beyond a couple
key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I made this higher CR than the party could fight when they first
encountered it. I used a remixed version of a Hill Giant's statblock,
which is CR 5. The party was level 3 when they first encountered
it.</li>
<li>This thing is a Construct, and as such requires no sleep, no rest,
it doesn't even stop marching unless its attacking someone. It is immune
to fear, sleep and charm as well.</li>
<li>A bit strange this one: Make it's attacks push the target up to 20ft
in any direction on a failed CON save. If they hit a solid surface, they
take bonus Bludgeoning damage and go <em>through</em> whatever they hit.
Nothing puts a little shock and awe in the PCs like watching their
Barbarian get punched straight through a wall, or the Wizard being
upper-cutted through the ceiling, even if they didn't take a lot of
damage.</li>
<li>And this is going to be the strangest change, and probably what will
make you question it: Make it Invulnerable. Not just extreme AC to make
it unhittable, but straight up immune to any conventional form of damage
as per the Invulnerability spell. Note that 'Conventional' part.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Dreadnought is a 7ft tall suit of plate armour, with no weapons
or spells. Beneath this shell, however, is the steel skeleton of the
real Dreadnought, driven ever onward by a blackened iron heart beating
in it's metal ribcage. It is in constant motion, always marching towards
its victims without rest and without pause. Crafted by a league of
Wizards and Artificers after they witnessed a Marut in action, they
attempted to recreate the Inevitable's ceaseless pursuit via more
ordinary means. While it cannot hold a handle to the terrible might of
an Inevitable, the Dreadnought is nevertheless a frightening assassin
and retriever. Since it's creation, the Dreadnought and the secret of
it's creation has changed hands more time than can be counted, but it
has always served it's master without fail.</p>
<p>The key to this creature is a system I called Shredding, named after
the similar system in XCOM 2. Basically, you can't damage this thing by
conventional means, and have to resort to 'shredding' its invulnerable
armour off over more than one encounter using, usually, environmental
tricks and traps. I had the Dreadnought start with 6 'armour health'.
The basic formula boils down to three 'tiers' of damage. First tier is
simple Environmental tricks: kicking it off a high place or collapsing a
stone roof onto it. Second tier is more targeted and explicitly lethal:
collapsing a mineshaft onto it or Getting a good shot with a siege
weapon. Finally, third tier is things that would be almost guaranteed
lethal in any other circumstance: Dropping it into lava or similarly
extreme methods fall into this tier.</p>
<p>The first time they met this walking tank, it was in an abandoned
fort. It slugged the Fighter straight through a solid stone wall and the
Rogue had a very tense few minutes hiding in the rafters as it marched
into the room, scanned it, and marched out. After a brief fight and a
chase, they lure it to the front of the fort and drop the portcullis on
top of it to stall it while they make their escape. The sharp metal
teeth of the portcullis ripped into it and 'shredded' two points off its
armour.</p>
<p>Next time they meet it, its armour is visibly damaged and a shoulder
guard is missing, but it still can't be hurt yet. After some clever
positioning, the Wizard used Shape Earth to rip out a chunk of the cliff
edge out from under it, sending it plummeting down a chasm. Despite the
fall, it was only an impact onto stone, one point shredded.</p>
<p>This went on a couple more times, the Dreadnought showing up at one
point in the middle of a Dungeon and making it a prolonged game of very
dangerous Hide and Seek. Eventually they shredded the last 3 points all
at once by luring it into a stockpile of explosive powder and blowing it
to kingdom come. I described the scene straight out of Terminator, the
now skeletal Dreadnought's form walking out of the flames.</p>
<p>After this, the Dreadnought has lost all it's invulnerability and
it's push effect, and that was signalled by it's complete lack of armour
and it's now exposed black heart. It will now also run full sprint at
the party instead of a march. The fight went by faster than usual, as it
was a four-on-one and they had levelled up to level 4 in the meantime.
During the fight, I described its form being broken apart: A good hit
ripped one of it's arms off, another blew a chunk from its head, etc.
And while the fight was pretty harsh, it was a total beatdown the party
felt they had earned after being hounded by this indestructible menace
for so long.</p>
<p>Of course, you can change factors if you want: More or less armour,
only certain methods can damage its armour, it can be deceived or
delayed by various means. This is less a creature and more an idea to
make something that genuinely feels intimidating to be stalked by: A
silent, looming thing that cannot be stopped, cannot be bargained with
and will not hesitate.</p>
<p>Unstoppable and Unavoidable, The Dreadnought is something that my
group enjoyed, and I hope yours will too.</p>
