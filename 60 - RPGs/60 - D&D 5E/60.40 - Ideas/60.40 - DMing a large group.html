<h2 id="herding-the-cats">Herding the Cats</h2>
<p>The most difficult aspect of handling larger groups is that they can
be rowdy. When there are 6+ people all talking over each other it can be
very difficult to keep anyone focused on the game at hand. With groups
this large you may even start to see multiple side conversations, and
instead of the game being one conversation between the DM and the
players, it's chaos. Fortunately, there are ways to combat this
issue.</p>
<p>Keeping people from talking over each other should be one of your
primary goals when handling a larger group. Quiet players can be drowned
out very easily and you will have multiple players asking "what
happened?" every time it comes back to their turn if multiple people are
talking over each other all the time. You can fix this by giving players
initiative outside of combat. Go in a circle around the table and ask
each player what they are doing. This gives them a mini spotlight and
lets them tell everybody what they are doing with no one talking over
them. If other people do start to talk over the player, ask them to be
quiet and give the player their spotlight.</p>
<h2 id="giving-them-chores">Giving them Chores</h2>
<p>Another problem that larger groups may have is players not staying
engaged with the game. When it takes a half hour to get to your turn
only for you to swing and miss, it's understandable that players will
get distracted and disengaged. This is bad though because when it
finally does come back to their turn, they will be lost and will need
you to reexplain the situation. To solve this problem you need to keep
them engaged when it isn't their turn, and you can do this by giving
them chores such as tracking initiative. Not only does this keep the
players on track, but it also helps you to stay focused. Here are some
examples of chores the players can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking Initiative and calling out who is on deck ("Baltair it's
your turn, Ava you're up next")</li>
<li>A designated rules lawyer ("What does Fairie Fire do again?")</li>
<li>Battlemap artist ("Who wants the marker?")</li>
<li>Official mini-mover ("I can't reach Tiamat, please don't put her in
the lava")</li>
<li>Notetaker ("Did I really name him bipple-baggle-bottoms?")</li>
<li>Music player ("Stop playing Never Gonna Give You Up or so help
me")</li>
<li>Distributor of wealth ("I'll have the glowy sword and you can keep
the copper pieces")</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing that should be mentioned is that once you get to a
large enough party size, you should always use a battle map and minis.
Having something you can quickly look at to refresh your memory is an
invaluable asset to have with a big group.</p>
<h2 id="combat-in-large-groups">Combat in Large Groups</h2>
<p>With this many players, challenging the party starts to become
difficult. Big ogres that are meant to be intimidating and scary could
roll bad at initiative once and be pulverised before they can even move.
Unless your players are all brand new to D&amp;D, one thing that would
be recommended is throwing higher challenge ratings at them. D&amp;D
players are extremely crafty folk and can come up with ways to win
encounters you may deem as unbeatable. Another thing you should do is
give the bad guys more actions. You can do this by either giving the big
bad monster legendary actions or by introducing a bunch of minions that
move independently of the big monster. (You should also give them an
auto-20 on initiative just to be safe).</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most important things you need to do with a large
group is to keep combat moving fast. If it takes a half hour for a turn
to go around the table your players will lose interest faster than a
sinking Galeb Duhr. Impose a time limit on turns and have them default
to a dodge action if they can't come up with something in 15-45 seconds.
Make your players plan their turn before it becomes their turn, and keep
things moving along at a fast pace. It should only take 3-5 minutes to
move around a table with as many as 8 people as long as everything is
going according to plan.</p>
