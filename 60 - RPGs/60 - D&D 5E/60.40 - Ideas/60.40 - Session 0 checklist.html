<body>
<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="session-0-checklist">Session 0 checklist</h1>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<h3 id="earning-exp">Earning EXP</h3>
<p>How do players earn EXP? Does the monster/creature have to be slain?
or are your monsters obstacles that simply need be overcome? What if the
players defeat a monster non-violently?</p>
<h3 id="milestones">Milestones</h3>
<p>DMG p 261. Do you use them?</p>
<h3 id="level-up">Level-up</h3>
<p>When do PCs level up? Long rest? Short rest? Once they are back in
town? only between game sessions? or the moment they gain enough
exp?</p>
<h2 id="player-behaviour-game-behaviour-dm-expectations">Player
Behaviour, Game Behaviour &amp; DM Expectations</h2>
<h3 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h3>
<p>Can players drink at the table? Do you care if your players get
drunk? What happens when someone gets drunk? What happens when a player
arrives to the session &amp; they are already drunk? Should there be
consequences, if so, what are the consequences?</p>
<h3 id="narcotics">Narcotics</h3>
<p>Same considerations as Alcohol, but perhaps you have different rules
&amp; consequences than with Alcohol. Though perhaps similar, I have
found it best to discuss this separately from Alcohol.</p>
<h3 id="cellphones-digital-devices">Cellphones &amp; Digital
Devices</h3>
<p>Do you allow them at the table? Do they need to be left in the basket
at the door? If you do allow them, what happens when a player gets a
call they must take? Do you allow headphone use at the table? Should
there be consequences for when this becomes a problem, if so, what are
the consequences?</p>
<h3 id="player-attention">Player Attention</h3>
<p>What happens if a player is constantly distracted? What happens if
they are constantly delaying the game because they are NOT paying
attention? Should there be consequences for when this becomes a problem,
if so, what are the consequences?</p>
<h3 id="disruptive-topics">Disruptive topics</h3>
<p>Are real-life topics like religion, politics, porn, or sex okay at
your table? What about sports? Are there other topics that are
disruptive? Maybe it's okay to talk about these kind of things before
the session starts, but not during the session? Many of these topics can
lead to heated discussions that can be disruptive to a game session
&amp; upsetting to other players. While this more applies to online
D&amp;D games, it can still be an issue for offline D&amp;D games as
well. Should players arrive an hour early so that they can do a bit of
socialising before the session?</p>
<h3 id="unannounced-dice-rolls">Unannounced dice rolls</h3>
<p>What happens when a player make a dice-rolls without saying anything,
only then to say, "I just rolled a nat-20 on my perception check." or
are only dice-rolls are allowed to me made when prompted? How are dice
rolls handled? Can players can make their rolls when they think they
need to?</p>
<h3 id="dice-rolls-against-one-another">Dice rolls against one
another</h3>
<p>Are dice rolls allowed to be used to settle in-character arguments?
Can the Bard PC roll to persuade the Fighter PC that his course of
action is right? Or is this kind of thing not allowed at all? or Is it
something that's allowed sparingly, but only under the DM's guidance, or
only when prompted by the DM? Perhaps everyone at the table has to agree
to allow such rolls first?</p>
<h3 id="player-vs-player">Player Vs Player</h3>
<p>Is tension between characters allowed? What about argument between
characters? Is combat between two or more PCs allowed? What happens when
character tension finally breaks out into violence between those two
characters? Is allowed only if the DM approves? Does the whole table
have to approve the PvP? What is your stance on PvP as a DM?</p>
<h3 id="pc-secrets">PC Secrets</h3>
<p>Are players allowed to keep in-game secrets from other players? Are
characters allowed to keep in-game secrets from other characters? If so,
who decides what secrets are allowed? Is this sort of thing left up to
the players? Is it only the privilege of the DM?</p>
<h3 id="player-expectations-types-goals-diversity">Player Expectations,
Types, Goals &amp; Diversity</h3>
<p>What happens when one players expectations ruins the fun of another
player? Does every player at your table need to be there for the same
reasons as ever other player? Is it okay for that Tim is only here for
the sweet loots &amp; EXP, while Mary-Sue is here to role-play her
snow-flake? Ann is just here to 'kill shit', while Steve has brought a
completely min/maxed PC to the table, &amp; poor Billy, he is here just
to hang out with is friends &amp; have pizza. DMs you may want to
discuss with each player at the table, why they are here &amp; what they
hope to get out of the game &amp; how you as a DM can meet those hopes
&amp; exceptions. If for some reason you can not, discuss that with the
player &amp; offer what you can do instead. After you have, you may want
to reinforce that you are all there to have fun, but have different
ideas of what fun is.</p>
<h3 id="player-discomfort">Player Discomfort</h3>
<p>Occasionally things may happen in-game that makes a player
uncomfortable. There maybe times where everyone agreed about a
particular topic in session-0, but when it actually surfaces in-game,
the player may find out that they in fact are NOT comfortable with it.
How are such things handled? Is there a time-out system? Does the DM
call a break and this become a table discussion? Is the player allowed
to step out on the scene &amp; come back after it has passed? Does the
DM use a RetCon to the story?</p>
<h3 id="player-agency">Player Agency</h3>
<p>As a DM, how do you feel about player agency? What is your stance on
it? Is it a possibility that the Warlock actually becomes possessed by
his Patron? What about when a PC becomes a Werewolf? When does that PC
become a DM controlled character? What are the ways PCs can use to
un-petrify their fellow PCs from the effects of a Basilisk?, a Medusa?
Historically, D&amp;D has not cared much about player agency, what the
DM said, is what happened but it has gotten significantly better about
it as the editions have passed, save-or-die effects kind-of linger but
are gone for the most part. Players (veteran or not) coming to play
D&amp;D though, may actually welcome &amp; want this kind of thing,
while other players may not. DMs you may want to discuss it with your
table.</p>
<h3 id="game-balance-fairness">Game Balance &amp; Fairness</h3>
<p>As a DM, what are your feelings about the balance of the game you are
playing? How will you as a DM handle encounter balance? Will you
constantly be throwing only Deadly encounters at the PCs? Perhaps you
feel that in this kind of sandbox campaign, players can stumble into the
Ancient Red Dragons lair at level 1? OR perhaps you feel that the game
is broken, or the balance it presents is a farce, so you will employ
other means of <em>being fair</em> to your players?</p>
<h3 id="rules-debates">Rules Debates</h3>
<p>As a DM, how do you handle rules debates? Does the game pause to look
up rules? Does the DM make a quick ruling to keep game flow &amp; then
the rule is looked up later? Perhaps as a DM you use some combination of
both?</p>
<h3 id="spotlight-sharing">Spotlight Sharing</h3>
<p>Are players allowed to have spot-light focus? or will the spot-light
only be focused on the party as a whole? Are players or characters
allowed to steal another PCs spotlight? What happens if a player or
his/her character tramples over another characters scene/spotlight? This
kind of thing can ruin another players fun, but it is also the kind of
that that the player won't immediately voice their discomfort about. DMs
you may want to try to be watchful of this.</p>
<h3 id="meta-knowledge">Meta-knowledge</h3>
<p>Do you allow it? Is it okay for players to know that swinging their
weapon as a ghost will not harm it? Are characters allowed to know that
trolls don't regenerate health when harmed with acid or fire? What about
when it comes to multiple rolls? Just because the Wizard player knows
the Rogue rolled low for his check for traps, would it make sense for
the Wizard character to insist that he check as well? If some
meta-knowledge is okay, and others are not, please discuss that with
your players. Though it gets talked about like its some sort of sin,
some meta-game knowledge is ok to have at your table as long as everyone
is having fun.</p>
<h3 id="minmaxing">MinMaxing</h3>
<p>What is your stance on this as a DM? Do you welcome optimised
characters, even if the character concept/theme is ridiculous? Perhaps
you simply tolerate it, as long as it doesn't become an issue? Or
perhaps you &amp; your players decided to play a campaign that is more
about ROLL-play than Role-play? Are veterans allowed to help newer
players optimise their PCs? If optimised PCs are allowed or encouraged,
you may want to let your players know that it is also fine to play
optimised characters as well.</p>
<h3 id="character-party-fit">Character Party fit</h3>
<p>That 'loner' character? Are they allowed? If so, at what limits? Is
it okay if a PC just tags along ONLY to do combat &amp; avoid anything
social? D&amp;D is a social based game, you may wish to encourage your
players to create characters that play well with others and that will
fit with the party. On the other hand, you may want to be mindful about
players potentially bullying other players into playing races &amp;
classes they do not want to play. Party fit should not limit class &amp;
race choice.</p>
<h3 id="murder-hobos">Murder Hobos</h3>
<p>What is your stance on this as a DM? Is it allowed? Is it allowed,
but there will be in-game consequences? Maybe your playing an evil
campaign, &amp; this is exactly what you want in this campaign. DMs
understand that D&amp;D by its nature &amp; history encourages this
style of game-play, so be forgiving but mindful.</p>
<h3 id="other-behaviour-rules">Other behaviour rules</h3>
<p>Perhaps this is where you tell your players to be respectful to one
another, or be communicative, etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-dm">The DM</h2>
<h3 id="dm-style">DM Style</h3>
<p>As a DM, what is your style? Are you a RAW or RAI type DM? Do you
prefer to improvise or prepare? Do you like making rulings on the spot
&amp; looking them up later, or would you rather pause the game &amp;
look up the rules? Do you like home-brewing &amp; having home-brew
content, or do you prefer to minimise home-brew? Do you prefer story
over mechanics? Do you want ROLL-play or roleplay? How do you prep for a
game-session? Share with your players your preferences as a DM.</p>
<h3 id="player-absences">Player Absences</h3>
<p>You may want to discuss with your players, how many players get to be
absent for the session before the game is cancelled that night? What is
the min amount of people you will DM for in a session? What happens when
too few players show up? Maybe the players that do show up get in some
'down-time' play that can provide minor benefits or perhaps progresses
some down-time activities that had going on? Maybe you can do a one-shot
you been planning for? What is your backup plan; play board-games,
video-games? watch movies?</p>
<h3 id="player-narrative-authority">Player Narrative Authority</h3>
<p>Do you allow your players to have some narrative authority in your
game? How much say do you allow in your game/campaign, for each player?
For example; Can the Cleric player create the deity she follows &amp;
you as a DM allow her to decide what her deity personality, attitudes,
domain, &amp; etc? Or does she have to select a deity from the book?
Does the Goliath have a tribe/herd? Who is the leader of his Herd? Does
the Paladin follow a specific sect or order? Maybe the Fighter is the
son of a Farmer? So now there is a whole farm in your game that, when
the party arrives at, the Fighter player now becomes an assistant DM.
This can go a LONG way to allowing your players feel ATTACHED to the
game setting.</p>
<h3 id="pet-peeves">Pet Peeves</h3>
<p>This is where you can discuss your own personal pet-peeves. Things
about the game that really bother you as a DM. It is okay to have them,
even though you may would rather avoid them. Just remember that when
discussing them, your coming from a place of kindness &amp; doing so to
inform them so to avoid issues later on.</p>
<h2 id="ethic-concerns-topics">Ethic Concerns &amp; Topics</h2>
<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p>This part will cover mature topics which may or may not trigger
people, it is not my intention to do so. This is in fact here to avoid
just suddenly triggering players, by bringing these out in the session-0
discussion. They can be discussed and should be discussed in a mature
respectful manor. Its important to include a preface to this topic-set.
Be as respectful &amp; as frank as possible but ask for forgiveness
incase you happen to fall short, these are not easy topics to discuss
but should be brought up at the table during Session-0 regardless. For
these topics, it is important to address every player at the table for
their individual input &amp; then individual consent.</p>
<h3 id="gender">Gender</h3>
<p>DMs consider discussing the gender roles, if any, in your setting and
the possibilities of encountering patriarchal or matriarchal cultures
&amp; how prevalent each are in this setting. What can characters find
as the most common 'norms' for gender roles. Bring up any race/culture
in your setting that has off-set or extremest views from the general
gender norms you described earlier. Consider discussing the topics of
creatures, deities &amp; magic items that can change gender, if any,
&amp; how common those are. (Succubus/Incubus come to mind.)</p>
<h3 id="attraction-sexual-orientation">Attraction &amp; Sexual
Orientation</h3>
<p>DMs consider discussing the possibilities of attraction or sexual
orientation of both the PCs &amp; the NPCs &amp; the populous, in
general, in your setting/campaign. Are there cultural stigmas on select
sexual orientations that span across multiple races? or does each
race/culture have different views that vary? or does each individual
make this decision for themselves? Does religion, does government have
an effect here? Are some cultures, religions or governments that are
more accepting than others? You may want to ask if it is alright for
their character to experience attraction from others that may not match
their personal views as a player. You may want to ask if they will be
unconformable as a player with seeing interactions in character that may
not align to their personal views.</p>
<h3 id="rape-sexual-assault">Rape, Sexual Assault</h3>
<p>DMs what is your stance on this topic? Are characters allowed to have
had this happen in their background/past? Maybe you do just limit it to
the past, but never the present. Can it happen to NPCs but not PCs? Are
characters allowed to perform these acts? If so, is it done only
'off-camera'?</p>
<h3 id="racism-prejudice">Racism, Prejudice</h3>
<p>Is this a fantasy setting where people are judged by their deeds
&amp; merit, on a person by person basis? Or do Elves hate Dwarves?, if
so why? Perhaps all the demi-human races view the goblinoid races with
disdain? Is it a race by race thing? Perhaps its all faction based?
Which cultures or races are more open-minded, which ones are hugely
xenophobic, which ones feel that their culture/race is superior?</p>
<h3 id="slavery">Slavery</h3>
<p>DMs consider discussing with your table, the stance you have on this
topic. Can PC expect to encounter enslaved NPCs? Can PC become enslaved,
or does it only happen to NPCs? Can this be a part of the PCs
background? If a PC does become enslaved, does the PC somehow become an
NPC? How is slavery viewed in your setting by the various cultures in
your game? Do only certain races seek to enslave others, or does every
race have the potential to take slaves? Perhaps a certain race, is a
slave race, similar to house-elves in Harry Potter?</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>After you have discussed this topics, it maybe best to conclude with
a reassuring follow-up. Remind there players that these are being
discussed now to avoid player discomfort later on, so that everyone can
have a fun game. Remind players that at any time, even if it goes
against what you agreed upon, or what was discussed during a Session-0
that they feel uncomfortable, to please say something.</p>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<h3 id="creation-questions">Creation Questions</h3>
<p>DMs if you have some questions you want your players to answer about
their characters during creation, this is the place to list them. You
may want to consider things like; Why is your character an adventurer?,
How is your character connected to at least one other character in the
group?, Who are your characters parents, siblings, mentors, etc?.</p>
<h3 id="creation-stats">Creation Stats</h3>
<p>Do you allow or restrict; the standard array, point buy, or rolling
for stats?. If PCs are allowed to roll, do you follow a house-rule set
or use the one from the PHB? Are PCs allowed to roll hit-dice for HP or
do they take the average?</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>How heavily is alignment featured in your game? Is alignment
perceptive or descriptive? What kind of things can cause a character to
change alignment? What happens when a character changes alignment? Is
there the potential for class features to because unusable or even lost
due to alignment change? Perhaps you do not allow PCs to have alignment,
but NPCs and monster do, just for those few game mechanics that rely on
it?</p>
<h3 id="stat-rulings">Stat rulings</h3>
<p>DMs if you have additional rules concerning stats, you may discuss
them here. Keep these rules only to stats that may affect character
creation, there will be another section for listing other mechanics that
may affect game-play and/or characters. Maybe you have an optional
Age-trade rule where the elderly gets a +2Wis but suffers a -1Dex &amp;
-1Con. Perhaps you have a house rule where characters with 8 or less
Int, can not read or write. Discuss these house-rules which have an
effect on attribute score decisions.</p>
<h3 id="other-creation-rules">Other Creation Rules</h3>
<p>If you have other rules or limitations or expansions on character
creation for your campaign, then list them here. Are you perhaps using
the Renown optional rules from the DMG here? Perhaps you allow every
player to get a feat at first level? If you restrict certain races or
classes or sub-classes, that is the for the next topic.</p>
<h2 id="races-classes">Races &amp; Classes</h2>
<h3 id="races-alloweddisallowed">Races Allowed/Disallowed</h3>
<p>Are there any races you disallow? Do you allow Flying Races? Do you
allow home-brew races? What if the home-brew race was a home-brew of
Kinder? would you allow that? Do you allow Unearthed Arcana Races?
Elemental Evil Races? Sword Coast Adventure Guide? Volo's Guide? What
about the Magic The Gathering Unearthed Arcana Races? Maybe you will
some races with a minor tweak to them?</p>
<h3 id="tweakingreflavour-races">Tweaking/Reflavour Races</h3>
<p>Can PCs make minor tweaks to a race? Can PCs reflavor a race to be a
different race? Do you allow PCs to play races they home-brewed
themselves?</p>
<h3 id="classes-allowed">Classes Allowed</h3>
<p>Are there any classes you disallow? Do you allow home-brew classes or
only home-brew classes from Mat Mercer &amp; Sterling Vermin? Do you
allow Unearthed Arcana classes/sub-classes, the Unearthed Arcana Mystic?
Sword Coast Adventure Guide sub-classes?</p>
<h3 id="tweakingreflavour-classes">Tweaking/Reflavour Classes</h3>
<p>Can PCs make minor tweaks to a class or subclass, if it fits a
certain theme that you as the DM can agree with? Can PCs reflavor a
class to be a different theme, such as a Bard reflavoured as Pro
Wrestler? Do you allow PCs to play home-brewed classes or
sub-classes?</p>
<h2 id="game-style-character-lifestyle">Game-style, Character
Lifestyle</h2>
<h3 id="type-of-game">Type of Game</h3>
<p>Is this a sandbox game? or more of a rail-road? perhaps its a
rail-road that leads to a sandbox game? perhaps a sandbox game where
players can jump on &amp; off the railroad only at certain points, or
perhaps whenever they like? Will the campaign be following a campaign
book, &amp; how closely will that be? Does the setting revolve around
the players? or are the players just a tiny cog in a much much larger
world? What kind of narrative with the game be? Is it something like
LotR or will it involve more mystery and conspiracy, or will it feature
heavy political themes, like Game of Thrones? (Expanded this topic
thanks to contributions by /u/AeoSC)</p>
<h3 id="campaign-lengt">Campaign Lengt</h3>
<p>Contributed by /u/AeoSC) - Discuss how long you think this campaign
will run for, will characters be able to reach level 9? level 14? How
many sessions you expect the campaign go?</p>
<h3 id="in-game-adventurers">In-game Adventurers</h3>
<p>What can PCs expect from being an adventurer? Are adventurers all
heroes? or are they perhaps members of an adventuring guild? or are they
all pirates on a pirate ship? perhaps they are all members of a faction?
Do Adventurers have 'normal lives' during downtime? How do NPCs
generally view adventurers? Is it favourable? or are they looked down
upon because they cause more trouble than good? Or perhaps because only
the desperate take up the adventuring life?</p>
<h3 id="in-game-politics-factions">In-game politics &amp; factions</h3>
<p>What are the various factions at play? can PCs join or already start
as members of a faction? What kind of government do the PCs live under?
Is it a feudal system? A magocracy? A republic? A tribe? Will the PCs be
able to choose to change factions or move to live under a different form
of government? What impact does the 'standard adventurer' have on the
political landscape? Can the PCs go beyond what the 'standard
adventurer' can do? Can the PCs effect change on the political
landscape? Can PCs become part of the government? Can PCs even overthrow
the government?</p>
<h3 id="startstanding">Start/Standing</h3>
<p>Are characters starting at 1st level, or perhaps at a higher level?
If they are starting off as a higher level, are these characters members
of a town? a guild? a religion? How long have they been members? How did
the character get their higher levels? During this time, have these
character somehow earned some minor notoriety?</p>
<h3 id="character-context">Character Context</h3>
<p>DMs you may want to consider covering the kinds of things that
character may know vs what the player may know &amp; the distinction
in-between. The character has potentially lived 15+ years in this
setting &amp; may know things that a player would not. DMs, if
meta-gaming is a concern for you, this is another place where you can
break it down, &amp; how you handle it. How can a player have access to
something the character may know, should know, will know? Do they roll
for this? Do they automatically become told this knowledge by the DM
when circumstances trigger it? Can players freely ask? Perhaps you use a
mix of all of the above.</p>
<h2 id="backgrounds-feats-mounts">Backgrounds, Feats &amp; Mounts</h2>
<h3 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h3>
<p>How do backgrounds effect the characters lifestyle? Do you as a DM
limited any backgrounds? Do you use backgrounds as all? If you do, do
you want final approval of each background selection? Do you allow
players to tweak or home-brew their own backgrounds? Have you
home-brewed any background for you to use in you campaign?</p>
<h3 id="feats">Feats</h3>
<p>Do feats, like the Actor feat, effect backgrounds and the characters
lifestyle? Do you as a DM limit any feats? If you allow feats, do you
want final approval of each feat selection? Do you allow for the
Unearthed Arcana Feats? Have you home-brewed any Feats for use in your
campaign? Have you tweaked some of the stock feats? Do you restrict or
allow the Lucky feat?</p>
<h3 id="mounts">Mounts</h3>
<p>As a DM, do you allow mounts? How do you handle mounts? Do you employ
the 'unstated mount rule'? Can PCs eventually obtain exotic mounts?
flying mounts? Keep in mind, that this ruling can devalue or raise the
value of some feats &amp; class features of the game. For those of you
wondering what the 'Unstated mount rule' is; It is an house-rule by some
DMs that; If you do not make the DM go out of his way to search the book
for mounted combat rules, then the DM will not go out of his/her way to
help your mount find an unfortunate death. Know that despite my
unfavourable wording of this rule, it is a fair rule &amp; has been
around D&amp;D for quite a long time.</p>
<h2 id="general-mechanic-rules">General Mechanic Rules</h2>
<h3 id="ready-an-action">Ready an Action</h3>
<p>DMs, this is confusing. It might be a good idea to cover &amp;
discuss this mechanic with your table. Consider perhaps going as far as
to break it down step-by-step the requirements for using this feature,
the cost, &amp; risk involved.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-actions">Bonus Actions</h3>
<p>You may want to clarify what a bonus action is, &amp; when it can be
taken and that wording is important. How do bonus actions work in
relation to the Ready an Action. If you use any house-rules for being
able to use a Bonus action as an Action, then list &amp; define that
here, or any other rules you have for bonus actions.</p>
<h3 id="repeated-party-rolls">Repeated Party Rolls</h3>
<p>DMs considering discussing how you handle these. Does the entire
party get to roll perception-checks to spot the hidden door &amp; you
take the highest? Perhaps you rule as a DM that only the person that
ask, gets to roll &amp; any additional PCs can provide the Help action
&amp; that is it? Perhaps you have a different system?</p>
<h3 id="downtimecrafting">Downtime/Crafting</h3>
<p>Is there down-time for your PCs? Do you use the downtime RAW? About
how much time passes between sessions/adventures? Do you have an
alternate down-time system? What do characters do during down-time, what
CAN they do during down time? What can PCs craft? Do you use crafting
RAW? or did you tweak it?</p>
<h3 id="additional-mechanic-rules">Additional mechanic rules</h3>
<p>If you have additional rules that focus on general game play that
isn't covered by another topic in this article, list them here. You may
want to consider additionally discussing; what is involved in Taming
creatures; how much damage you get from Lava/Magma; the breakdown of how
Dark-vision, Darkness, &amp; Dim light work, in addition to your other
house-rules.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<h3 id="snacks">Snacks</h3>
<p>Do you allow the players that bring snacks for everyone to gain free
inspiration? If not, maybe you can use this as an aside for discussing
session snaking and food, if any.</p>
<h3 id="gaining-inspiration">Gaining Inspiration</h3>
<p>How do players gain inspiration? Does the DM award it? Do players
award each other? If players award each other, does the DM have 'veto'
power? Can players have multiple sources of inspiration? Can players
have more than one inspiration at a time? Perhaps you scrap the
inspiration system because its tedious &amp; everyone seems to forget
about it?</p>
<h3 id="tracking-inspiration">Tracking Inspiration</h3>
<p>Does the player with inspiration get a special dice? a special token?
Can you keep inspiration from the end of one gaming session to the next
gaming session? Can players SHARE inspiration freely with one
another?</p>
<h3 id="spending-inspiration">Spending Inspiration</h3>
<p>How does a player spend inspiration? Does inspiration &amp; bardic
inspiration provide some sort of super inspiration? If a player somehow
has a pool of inspiration tokens, can a player use spend more than one
of those on a single roll? Can a player use Inspiration after seeing the
result of the dice, or does it have to be declared before?</p>
<h2 id="advantage-disadvantage-ability-checks">Advantage, Disadvantage
&amp; Ability Checks</h2>
<h3 id="stacking">Stacking</h3>
<p>As a DM, do you allow multiple sources of disadvantage/advantage
stack? Does this stacking only apply when one is used to cancel the
other? Even if they stack, do you still only roll with 1 additional
advantage/disadvantage dice?</p>
<h3 id="giving-aid">Giving Aid</h3>
<p>Does providing aid, provide straight advantage; or perhaps does the
PC giving aid need proficiency in the skill they are using in making the
check? Are those perception checks or the Search actions, exempt from
this ruling? Is there a time limit on the kind of task that PC an
provide aid for?</p>
<h3 id="multiple-attempts">Multiple Attempts</h3>
<p>Can a rogue make that lock picking attempt over &amp; over &amp; over
again? As a DM, at what point do you draw the line on multiple attempts?
Perhaps as a DM, you would raise the DC in such a case? If so, state
what it is. What if the Bard gives the Rogue his bardic inspiration,
does this perhaps reset the DC to what it was? What if the rogue took a
short rest before trying again? What if the rogue instead spends his
inspiration?</p>
<h2 id="crits">Crits</h2>
<h3 id="critical-hits">Critical Hits</h3>
<p>RAW? or do you roll &amp; add maximised damage &amp; then add
modifiers? Maybe you will allow your players to choose for each
campaign? Maybe you have an alternate method; if so, what is it?</p>
<h3 id="critical-fumbles">Critical Fumbles</h3>
<p>Is this a rule in your game? Do you have a table, if so, what is on
your fumble table? The fumble-table is something every player should be
able to readily access. If you do not have a fumble table, do you
instead improvise what happens on a crit-fumble?</p>
<h3 id="critical-success">Critical Success</h3>
<p>Nat-20 on an ability check/save means what? What does it mean to the
narrative? Do rolling a Nat-20 allow a player to get what they are
after, no matter the circumstances or the ridiculousness of the roll?
Would such a roll be immediately apparent in the narrative, or would it
go perhaps unnoticed?</p>
<h3 id="critical-fail">Critical Fail</h3>
<p>Nat-1 on an ability check/save means what? What does it mean to the
narrative? Would such a roll be immediately apparent in the narrative,
or would it go perhaps unnoticed?</p>
<h2 id="sneaky">Sneaky</h2>
<h3 id="stealth">Stealth</h3>
<p>Do you allow stealth movement in your game? How is accomplished? Do
you require that the movement be immediately from one hiding spot to the
next? Can stealth be accomplished in combat, or is it only out of
combat? Consider taking the time to emphasise how Stealth/hiding in
D&amp;D is greatly different from what players may have experienced in
video-games.</p>
<h3 id="unseen-attacker">Unseen Attacker</h3>
<p>What does it mean to be an unseen attacker? How does cover play into
effect here? How actions/things causes an unseen attack to become
revealed? How does such an attack go back to being an Unseen Attacker?
Can enemies even 'target' an unseen attacker?</p>
<h3 id="hiddenhide-action">Hidden/Hide Action</h3>
<p>What does it mean to be hidden? Can a hidden creature be a 'valid
target'? If they can, what penalties does the attacker have against the
hidden creature? What actions/things causes an hidden creature to become
un-hidden? How does such a creature go back to being Hidden? Can a
hidden creature clearly attack an un-hidden creature without
penalty?</p>
<h3 id="invisibility">Invisibility</h3>
<p>What does it mean to be invisible? Can an invisible creature be a
'valid target'? If they can, what penalties do they have? What
actions/things causes an invisible creature to become revealed or a
target? How does an invisible creature go back to being un-revealed?</p>
<h3 id="traps">Traps</h3>
<p>Do you as a DM use the new Unearthed Arcana rule-set for traps? Are
traps a heavy feature in your game? How often can adventurers be
expected to encounter a trap? Do overcoming/defeating traps provide EXP?
If so, how much EXP can players expect?</p>
<h2 id="npcscreatures">NPCs/Creatures</h2>
<h3 id="group-inits">Group Inits</h3>
<p>As a DM, do you use them? If so, how? Do you break up large groups
into smaller ones? If you do not use Group Inits, what do you use
instead?</p>
<h3 id="vendors">Vendors</h3>
<p>Most NPCs vendors will sell items for what cost? for base-price?
base-price+10%, +20%? will most vendors haggle or only some of them? or
will vendors not haggle at all?</p>
<h3 id="other-creature-rules">Other Creature rules</h3>
<p>List any other creature rules you may have. Creatures in particular
you may want to consider discuss are; Lycanthropes, Vampires, Intellect
Devourers, Basilisk, &amp; Medusa. These are the creatures that
potentially have the likelihood of taking away player agency. (If there
are other creatures that are 'agency thieves' that I failed to think of,
post below &amp; I will update this list.)</p>
<h2 id="magic-items">Magic Items</h2>
<h3 id="attunementidentify">Attunement/Identify</h3>
<p>Does attunement reveal everything about an item, or do PCs need to
identify them to get the full list of everything an item can do? Do PCs
need to identify an item before being able to attune to it?</p>
<h3 id="magic-resize">Magic Resize</h3>
<p>Do wearable items auto-magically resize to fit their wearer? If not,
is there a way to resize such items? Perhaps only Rare &amp; above items
resize while uncommon does not? Perhaps only if you attune to the item,
will it resize? Maybe all magical items auto-resize? Maybe its a case by
case basis?</p>
<h3 id="other-magic-item-rules">Other magic item rules</h3>
<p>List any other magical items rules you may have.</p>
<h2 id="spells-spell-effects">Spells &amp; Spell Effects</h2>
<h3 id="additionalcustomised-spells">Additional/Customised spells</h3>
<p>Elemental evil spells, do you allow them? Do you allow spells from
the Unearthed Arcana: That Old Black Magic? Do you allow for homebrewed
spells? Do you allow any class to make tweaks to spells, or do you limit
that kind of thing to only the Sorcerer? If spells can be tweaked, what
kind of tweaks can be made? Damage-type? Range? Duration? etc.</p>
<h3 id="spells-vs-environments">Spells Vs Environments</h3>
<p>Do spells work differently in different environments? Do fire spells
work underwater? what about lightning spells underwater? Do ice spells
work on the Plane of Fire? Do you have guidelines or do you make
judgement calls when such circumstances happen?</p>
<h3 id="spell-abuse">Spell Abuse</h3>
<p>As a DM how do you handle things if a caster starts using spells
abusively? What do you consider to be spell abuse?</p>
<h3 id="spell-casting-juggling">Spell Casting &amp; Juggling</h3>
<p>Do players need to keep track of which hand carries their components,
which hand they use for somatic gestures, which hand they use for foci,
which hands holds their spell-book, &amp; which hand they use for
weapons? Or perhaps as DM, you don't care as long as it isn't breaking
the action economy? Do you strictly enforce spell-casting rules via RAW,
or do you allow some leniency?</p>
<h3 id="material-components">Material Components</h3>
<p>Do spell casters need to keep track of what components they have? or
can they just simply deduct 50 GP for that diamond they need for
Chromatic Orb? Perhaps you decided to wave all the material cost of
spell components for spells below 6th level? Consider discussing what
you as a DM expect from your caster players.</p>
<h3 id="spell-tweaks">Spell Tweaks</h3>
<p>DMs list your spell tweaks here. Perhaps the Grease spell is
flammable? Maybe you found on Reddit a better version of True Strike
cantrip that you would like to use. Maybe you renamed Chill Touch so
that its name is less confusing? Maybe you tweaked/expanded on how Charm
&amp; Illusion spells work? Perhaps if the Bard can make his/her Vicious
Mockery funny enough to make you laugh, it auto-crits?</p>
<h2 id="death-resurrection-resting">Death, Resurrection, Resting</h2>
<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>What happens when a PC dies? What happens when there is a TPK? Does
the game end? Does it mean that time passes &amp; events progress a
certain number of years before the players can create new PCs? Should
every player have a backup character ready to go? <strong><em>Make sure
your players know what it means when these events happens; this is
something often forgotten about that brand new players need to
know.</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="resurrection">Resurrection</h3>
<p>What options, in the setting or in the game, do players have for
resurrecting fallen PCs? Is this the privy of high-level PCs &amp; Gods,
or can anyone bring the corpse of a fallen ally to the resurrection
temple &amp; pay a huge sum of money to resurrect a character? Do you
have an alternate set of Resurrection rules. Did you pick up the
rule-set that Mat Mercer recently refined for his PC resurrections? Even
if you follow resurrection RAW, what impact does resurrection have
in-game? Is this a common occurrence in this setting? or is it something
special &amp; unique? Will characters be expected to go get a special
Mcguffin (like unicorn blood, angel tears, phoenix down) otherwise
resurrection spells will automatically fail?</p>
<h3 id="death-rules">Death Rules</h3>
<p>DMs if you have game mechanic rules for when PCs die, discuss them
here. What about Massive Damage rules; does it outright kill you? A
common rule seems to be Death Exhaustion: When a character regains 1hp
from after being dropped to 0hp, that character gains one level of
exhaustion.</p>
<h3 id="resting-rules">Resting Rules</h3>
<p>DMs if you have rules for rest mechanics discuss them here. A common
rule seems to be only 2 short rest before a long rest. Another common is
that a Long Rest always starts with a Short rest.</p>
