<h1 id="adding-horror-to-your-game">Adding horror to your game</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-horror">What is Horror?</h2>
<p>Horror is defined as an intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust.
It comes from the Latin horrere, which means to tremble or shudder - an
important distinction, because this means horror is visceral and often
involuntary. Unlike Intrigue, Horror is a reaction, not a process.</p>
<p>A “Horror Campaign” will likely have a relentlessly grim tone and
lots of gory monsters. While that sounds like an incredibly fun game to
play in, we can use those elements to create moments of horror to
punctuate otherwise upbeat campaigns.</p>
<h2 id="three-types-of-horror">Three Types of Horror</h2>
<p>There are many kinds of horror, but for the sake of symmetry and
simplicity, it can be divided it into three rough categories, each
eliciting a slightly different reaction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Atmospheric Horror (the Unknown) taps into your primal fears about
darkness and the things you cannot see.</li>
<li>Visceral Horror (the Unpleasant) taps into your primal fears about
your body and the “right” way for living things to exist.</li>
<li>Surreal Horror (the Unfathomable) taps into your primal fears about
the existence and fragility of your reality itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you’ll see, these three categories often appear blended together
or leading into one another. You might use Atmospheric Horror tactics to
set up a big Surreal or Visceral reveal, for example.</p>
<h2 id="atmospheric-horror-the-unknown">Atmospheric Horror (the
Unknown)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oh, cool. A dark basement. I was just thinking we should be doing
this in a dark basement.” -Jeff Winger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Atmospheric Horror is achieved mainly through description: a swinging
lantern, a discordant melody, an uncomfortable silence. Atmospheric
Horror is looking out your window in the middle of the night and
swearing that you see a figure in the yard. As a DM, this type of horror
provides the most bang for your buck, because its power lies in the
realm of description and suspense. Nothing is happening - yet. And the
monsters that players imagine will always be worse than the monster you
put in front of them.</p>
<p>Atmospheric Horror can be used alone just to set a mood, but it’s
also an important setup for the other two types of horror discussed
here. It’s also the most readily available and safest to use. At its
core, atmospheric horror cannot hurt the players - if it does, then it
stops becoming atmospheric, either becoming visceral horror or classic
adventure combat. However, it may not be suitable for players with
anxiety-related issues, so be wary.</p>
<p>Examples in Media: The Shining, It Follows, Get Out, A Quiet Place
(mostly). Atmospheric Horror usually serves as a double-feature with
other types of horror described below.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-atmospheric-horror">How to Use Atmospheric
Horror</h3>
<p>At the table, music can be a powerful tool to set the mood.
Everything from subtle, ominous sounds to the Lavender Town theme song
can be used to put players on edge.</p>
<p>When it comes to the story, description is king. Atmospheric horror
involves darkness, the unknown, and a sense of claustrophobia as the
world tries to restrict the characters’ movement. Moreover, it typically
involves something out of place--not where it should be. Something isn't
quite right.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The door creaks open, revealing only a dim stone chamber. The steady
drip, drip, drip of water meets your ear.</li>
<li>As you run your finger along the ground, a layer of grime clings to
your skin. The wallpaper is yellow and peeling, drooping down toward you
and making the room feel even smaller.</li>
<li>The trees sway softly in the wind. You draw closer and find the
remains of a squirrel - squashed and torn apart - nailed to one of the
trunks. The wind whispers through the branches, rustling leaves. And
then, abruptly, all goes still.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="visceral-horror-the-unpleasant">Visceral Horror (the
Unpleasant)</h2>
<p>Visceral horror is your classic monsters, gore, and body horror.
Fundamentally, it’s the horrible things that make us squirm. It’s the
character's first sight of a Beholder. It’s finding a dead dwarf with
half his skull missing and the brain sucked out like an oyster. It’s
jumpscare and the maggots and the flesh-eating ghouls.</p>
<p>Note: visceral horror runs the risk of becoming self-indulgent and
genuinely upsetting for players. This type of horror requires a delicate
hand, subtlety, and humility. Use with consent - knowing your players'
boundaries - and use it sparingly.</p>
<p>Examples: Alien, first and foremost. Just about anything with gore,
plenty of gory horror movies and stories are out there.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-visceral-horror">How to use Visceral Horror</h3>
<p>Sparingly. Once more, the key lies in the description. This kind of
horror generally lies in the places where things have gone wrong, or in
well-recognised symbols of fear. For example: a creature with mouths
where its eyes should be, or an eye where its mouth should be. The Alien
from Aliens in all of its glory. The Nazis at the end of Raiders right
as they’re melting (or the Nazis at the end of Last Crusade, right as
he’s ageing). Leathery skin, exposed brains, tentacles, slime, etc.</p>
<p>A gelatinous cube isn’t scary if you just describe it as a ten-foot
cube. But start describing its slow, crawling movement, the
half-dissolved face of a screaming corpse trapped in the gel, and the
rigid, burning gel that engulfs a character, impeding their movement and
cutting off their air? That’s pretty scary.</p>
<p>Some DMs are masters of evocative word choice, horrifying sound
effects, and grotesque metaphors. You can be more direct if you want to;
imagining a horrifying image and then describing it in plain,
straightforward language. Below are some examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>A mindflayer wraps its tentacles around a duergar's head as the
dwarf twitches madly, his screams muffled. You hear a faint creaking
sound, then a gut-wrenching snap. The duergar goes limp, followed by a
loud sucking sound. The tentacles release and the body drops to the
ground in a mangled mess.</li>
<li>The jagged, blood-stained teeth sit on the lumpy creature’s stomach,
while its head is a smooth mash of grey flesh. It lumbers toward you
with the uncertain steps of a newborn baby, fleshy hands dragging
against the ground.</li>
<li>The hunched hag with mottled skin and ragged clothes has her back to
you, revealing branches and rocks protruding from her flesh. Her head
turns slowly to face you while the body stays in place. She grins madly.
Suddenly she spins, bounding toward you, limbs flailing wildly as
spittle flies from her teeth.</li>
</ul>
<p>The line between visceral and atmospheric is blurry at best. Spiders
scurrying on the walls might be considered atmospheric, while a swarm of
spiders crawling on a character is likely to feel visceral.</p>
<h2 id="surreal-horror-the-unfathomable">Surreal Horror (the
Unfathomable)</h2>
<p>Surreal Horror is probably the most difficult form of horror to pull
off - but the most rewarding if successful. It’s hard to pin down a
definition. It’s when everybody on the street turns to stare at you for
five seconds before going on their way like nothing happened. It’s when
you trip on the street and fall into a non-Euclidean hellscape. It's the
moment when you realise reality as you understand it is fundamentally
broken.</p>
<p>It is VERY hard to come back from true surreal horror that breaks
reality, which is why it tends to work best in shorter-term games built
expressly for that purpose (e.g. Call of Cthulhu). An easier option is
to deploy a monster such as the False Hydra, which plays with memory and
narrative itself. Deploying one such monster can irrevocably change the
tone of a game, so be wary. Still, it's the kind of mind-bending horror
I'd love to explore someday.</p>
<p>Notably, this is also the form of horror closest to gaslighting, and
so requires serious consideration and consent from players before
engaging.</p>
<p>Examples in Media: The Matrix, Total Recall, The Nine Million Names
of God, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream. Many episodes of The Twilight
Zone, such as Time Enough at Last. The Truman Show kind of falls into
this.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-surreal-horror">How to use Surreal Horror</h3>
<p>Surreal Horror is almost impossible to pull off alone; it’s best to
use Atmospheric Horror tactics to set things up.</p>
<h4 id="the-false-hydra">The False Hydra</h4>
<p>The False Hydra is an aberration that is blocked from the memory of
anybody who hears its eerie song. When it wants to eat, the Hydra
extends one of its enormous necks, briefly stops singing its song, and
chooses prey to target. Those who are eaten are completely wiped from
memory.</p>
<p>The design of the Hydra is already terrifying. A pale, swelling
creature with snake-like necks and almost-human faces is horrible. Its
source or seed can be a bulbous, cancerous growth that cannot move; the
Hydra is rooted where it was born, and only its necks can move. Once
characters realise the trick, they can find and kill the source, but
it’s going to be a vile and revolting process filled with bursts of
yellow blood, rubbery skin, and the overwhelming stench of rotten
flesh.</p>
<p>The moment of peak horror that you can use is this: once characters
have pieced together the Hydra's ability, one or more of them cover
their ears or cast Silence. Directly in front of them, now visible, are
the horrific visage and enormous neck of one of the Hydra's heads - it
has been watching and waiting the whole time. Alternatively, if the
Hydra isn't attacking, they cover their ears and look out the window,
seeing for the first time a half-dozen enormous necks spreading around
the town. This is the peak Surreal moment, when characters realise the
truth of the reality around them.</p>
<p>How do you ramp up to this moment? You can do so by creating an
unsettling Atmosphere.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello Jack. I hope you’ve been well. Since you left Cobyr Square
after HE your father’s death, the place has not been the same. I implore
you to come and visit us once again. A IS bad case of insomnia has
recently swept the city and it has affected WATCHING me as well despite
my best efforts. I have not yet found a remedy for the ailment and I
fear they it US may be a symptom for a larger problem. We could use
someone with your expertise. God’s speed! Your friend, Tyrnan
Altek.</li>
</ul>
<p>This tool sets up a dissonance in reality - two messages overlapping,
one of them horrifying while the other is pleasantly plain. Other
examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spot where the deaf beggar once sat is now long empty. His
blanket and hat with a few silver pieces lie dormant. The party might
notice how some folk will briefly stop at the site before walking on,
confused only for a few seconds</li>
<li>Players hear a scream from around the corner! When they arrive at
the scene they just see a woman casually picking up some fallen apples
from the ground and continue on her way as if nothing has happened.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, the horror doesn’t stem from the darkness or the grime
- that is, it’s not just a bodily threat that the characters can’t see.
The False Hydra hides from the players’ memories and perception of
reality itself.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-horror">Why Use Horror?</h2>
<p>Fear is one of those primal emotions in humans - the other being
laughter. Both a panicked cry and a sudden laugh are involuntary
physical reactions to a stimulus. When role-playing, we're embodying a
character to feel their triumphs and pains, but fear and laughter are
the most potent.</p>
<p>Well-used horror ramps up stakes, slowly winding up the tension
before allowing for some kind of catharsis at the end. That catharsis
could be classic horror - total failure and death at worst, just barely
surviving at best. For an average D&amp;D game, catharsis probably
should include an adventurous heroic battle that ends in victory, but
that's just personal taste. Regardless, horror elements make that epic
catharsis feel more epic.</p>
