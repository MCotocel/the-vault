<h1 id="making-mimics-scarier">Making mimics scarier</h1>
<p>In this post, I will outline a different philosophy for running
mimics that makes them a far more dangerous and versatile enemy than
described in the Monster Manual. I'm going to follow Matt Colville's
method and put the best stuff first.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like dragons, mimics grow both physically and mentally for their
entire lives. They are immortal and there is no known upper limit on
their size. They absorb the flesh of their victims and add it to their
own mass.</li>
<li>Mimics can reshape their body at will in a matter of seconds order
to grant themselves beneficial attributes for a given situation. They
are not limited to mimicking inanimate objects; they can mimic animals,
monsters, humanoids…any creature the mimic has seen before is fair game.
The smarter ones can even take on new forms never seen before. Their
only limits are physics (conservation of mass) and their own memories
and experiences…which grow as the mimic ages.</li>
<li>Take a minute to think about how many options this gives you when
running this monster. Need to do more damage? Give yourself another set
of claws or mouths. Want to grapple the tank? Grow four extra arms
and/or tentacles and wrap them up. Having trouble spotting the rogue in
the shadows? Grow a couple dozen extra eyes. Getting attacked too many
times per round? Cover your entire body in bone armour, and/or give
yourself porcupine levels of spikes so people take damage every time
they hit you. Taking a lot of thunder damage? Get rid of your ears and
give yourself resistance. The mage staying out of reach? Give your arm
three extra elbows and grab him. With a little ingenuity, you can turn
an underwhelming trap monster into a beast capable of threatening even
high-level parties.</li>
<li>No matter the situation, you can gain or lose the features that are
the most advantageous for you at the time, so even if the players feel
they’ve gotten the upper hand, you can flip the script on them. Even if
the mimic isn’t threatening to TPK them, you can really frustrate your
players by never letting them pin it down and force it to fight on their
terms. Your description of the combat will help reinforce this
perception. Don’t just describe the blow hitting the PC, describe how
the PC dodges out of the way of the blow, but the arm lengthens by six
inches mid-swing to turn it into a hit anyway. The arrow didn’t miss the
mimic, the mimic’s flesh moved out of the path of the arrow and the
arrow sailed through the hole. Never miss an opportunity to remind the
players that the battle would be going more in their favour, but the
mimic keeps changing the rules.</li>
<li>The best part is, this approach is really easy to scale up or down
to the level of your party. Just raise or lower the mimic’s hit points,
attack bonus, and number of attacks as appropriate, and the combat will
still have a unique feel at high levels or low ones without being
unbalanced. As you scale a mimic up to Large- or Huge-sized, you can
increase the number of separate augmentations it can have up at a time.
Maybe a Medium mimic can only grow two extra limbs or extend its reach
by 10 feet, while a Huge mimic can have six 20-foot tentacles, a
rhino-like body structure, and a gore/bite/trample combo all available
to it at once. And since their intelligence is variable, you can play
mimics with more/less strategic thinking depending on whether you need
to make the encounter easier or harder. Your mimic can be a cunning
opponent that changes the tone of the combat on every turn, or it can be
a chest that figured out how to give itself arms and doesn’t have any
other gimmicks.</li>
<li>Naturally, this versatility makes it a little pointless for me to
list a specific stat block here. If you want to be rigorous about it,
you can make a list of your mimic’s menu of possible abilities before
the party encounters it, but the fluid nature of the mimic means that
you can come up with new ones on the fly fairly easily. So long as you
keep it somewhat reasonable, like only one form change per turn as a
bonus action, your players should accept it without too much
questioning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some general features you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reach</li>
<li>Switch between bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage as
needed</li>
<li>Advantage on any skill any animal could be reasonably expected to
have (Perception and Stealth are the big ones)</li>
<li>Advantage on grapple checks</li>
<li>Climb, swim, or fly speed as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some extra features you can add to challenge a
high-level party:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skin covered in mouths that latch onto anything they touch and start
chewing. This ability actually fits well with the mimic’s existing
Adhesive property; you just add some damage for any character that
starts their turn grappled by the mimic.</li>
<li>Grapple-on-hit attacks like chuuls, ropers, snakes, and others.</li>
<li>Extra bone/scale armor for damage resistance or high AC</li>
<li>Regeneration</li>
<li>Ooze-like engulf ability</li>
<li>Magic resistance</li>
<li>Active camouflage, ranging from advantage on Stealth checks to de
facto invisibility</li>
<li>Ability to mimic magical abilities (dragon’s breath, displacer beast
displacement, etc.). Maybe let it only use the features of its past
victims?</li>
<li>Immunity to flanking or (if you feel really mean) the rogue’s sneak
attack feature</li>
<li>Disguises itself as another, weaker monster to draw in unwary
adventurers</li>
<li>Ability to perfectly mimic the appearance and voice of a party
member (combine with a telepathic ally for real-time mirroring)</li>
<li>Potential flaw: will devour itself over time in the absence of
food</li>
</ul>
<p>To add veracity, you can restrain yourself to only features possessed
by other monsters in the area. Some features my mimic used in an
Underdark setting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Echolocation of a hook horror</li>
<li>Tendrils of a roper</li>
<li>Sense of smell &amp; stealth of a hunting cat (displacer beast)</li>
<li>Wings of a cloaker</li>
</ul>
<p>Through 10 levels of a 5e campaign, this variant mimic is one of the
few monsters my party straight up decided they didn’t want to fight. All
I had to do was have them come upon a slaughtered goblin village with
almost all of the bodies missing, just a few scattered hands and feet
left. The tracks changed from giant pawprints to a slithering trail,
then disappeared when the cave opened up into a larger cavern. I had
their NPC guide react with terror and explain what this was, and my
players noped out of the mimic’s entire territory.</p>
<p>The cherry on top that really sells this monster is your flavor
description. You shouldn’t just describe it as shapeless and amorphous
like an ooze; if your players are anything like mine, they start to view
oozes as little more than annoying Jell-O molds after a few encounters.
Instead, make sure the players understand that this is the ideal union
of mind and flesh…a creature whose body can perfectly accommodate any
designs of its guiding intelligence. Every time it takes a new form,
that new shape looks as real as the actual animal it is based on, right
up until it unnaturally twists, elongates, and reforms like a Surrealist
painting come to life. A nightmare made flesh, bristling with spines,
horns, teeth, claws, eyes, and limbs in unnatural and malevolent
configurations. Really lean into the body horror aspect and try to draw
inspiration from any medium you can think of. I scared the crap out of
my characters by giving my mimic the Predator clicking sound, echoing
through the passageways of the Underdark as it hunted the party. If you
do this right, your players will envision something less like Reed
Richards and more like The Maker.</p>
