<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="the-active-dungeon-vs-the-passive-dungeon">The active dungeon vs
the passive dungeon</h1>
<h2 id="passive">Passive</h2>
<p>The passive dungeon is what I’d say the majority of dungeons are.
They are locations in the world that the players can explore and engage
with, fighting enemies, avoiding obstacles, disarming traps, all that
sort of stuff. ‘Passive’ here doesn’t mean that the dungeon is peaceful
and devoid of combat, it means that the dungeon largely exists in a
state agnostic of the party’s presence there.</p>
<h2 id="active">Active</h2>
<p>The active dungeon is, by comparison, a dungeon that is actively
responding to the players as they traverse it. A great example of this
is raiding a necromancer’s castle in a multi-day military-style
operation. The party is trying to slog through each room, clearing it
out and securing vital objectives, while at the same time the
necromancer is trying to actively oppose the party by throwing enemies
at them and creating obstacles to impede or entirely prevent the party’s
progress.</p>
<h2 id="active-aggressive">Active Aggressive</h2>
<p>I don’t want to talk too much about the passive dungeon as it’s the
one we’re generally most familiar with. Instead I want to break down
exactly what sorts of things go on in active dungeons before we look at
the pros and cons of each.</p>
<p>In general, the challenges of an active dungeon all spring from the
underlying fact that something elsewhere in the dungeon (probably the
thing the party is trying to get to and destroy) is actively and
continuously trying to counteract the party’s actions.</p>
<p>Most monster lairs fall into this category, as in theory there is an
occupant that is actively trying to kill the party just as the party is
actively trying to kill it.</p>
<p>In the example given of clearing a castle occupied by a necromancer
combats will naturally be against their hordes of undead. Then once a
room is cleared out the necromancer may try to actively take it back by
sending more undead at the party.</p>
<p>As the party progresses they may come across booby traps that have
been specifically built to stop the party from getting further. This
plays out less like the classic ‘swinging blades in a corridor’ and more
like a siege with the defenders taking countermeasures. Doors may be
rigged to explode, water sources may be poisoned, staircases may have
been intentionally destroyed.</p>
<p>Then there are factors like the party having to securely find ways to
rest. There’s always the general wisdom of ‘the monsters won’t just wait
around while the party rests’, but this goes a step beyond that. The
monsters may actively wait for the party to need to rest and try to
ambush them in their sleep. This creates an arms race of the party
needing to create secure locations to rest, with the denizens of the
dungeon trying to make such places impossible to create or counter
whatever measures the party puts in place to enable their rest.</p>
<p>The active dungeon is almost more like a tactical game between the
party and the dungeon’s occupants, full of moves and countermoves. In
clearing out the dungeon, the party has won a great protracted
battle.</p>
<h2 id="passive-in-brief">Passive In Brief</h2>
<p>Where the active dungeon might be storming a necromancer’s castle,
the passive dungeon is raiding the long-dead necromancer’s crypt. Booby
traps may have been built to dissuade graverobbers, skeletons animated
in centuries long past may be standing ready in rooms to guard the tomb,
there may even be riddles that must be solved to prove the intruder is
worthy of the deceased’s treasures.</p>
<p>This dungeon has obstacles and it has things the party is actively
engaging with, but the dungeon itself does very little in the ways of
actively responding to the party aside from a few instances of enemies
now aware of the party’s presence readying themselves for the party’s
eventual arrival to their chamber.</p>
<h2 id="the-pros-and-cons-of-each">The Pros and Cons of Each</h2>
<p>I think it’s easy to read this and feel active dungeons are probably
better than passive dungeons since they’re more ‘alive’, and having a
dungeon actively responding to the party’s actions can make it feel more
bespoke, but there’s a lot to be said in favour of passive dungeons.
Let’s look at them both now.</p>
<h3 id="active-dungeons">Active Dungeons</h3>
<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide out-of-combat strategic opportunities a layer above
in-combat tactics</li>
<li>The gameplay loop of moves and countermoves is generally
satisfying</li>
<li>Can have a strong sense of progression as earlier parts of the
dungeon are made safer</li>
<li>Generate satisfying conclusions as the party wins a war of
attrition</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can become a slog</li>
<li>Leave little room for things like puzzles and riddles, which many
players enjoy</li>
<li>Combat-heavy and may have little variety as a result</li>
<li>Require contrivances of intelligent enemies being holed-up in a
location in order to function</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="passive-dungeons">Passive Dungeons</h3>
<h4 id="pros-1">Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can help create a sense of ‘deep history’ through forgotten ruins
and ancient structures</li>
<li>Extremely flexible in terms of accommodating a variety of
challenges</li>
<li>Can exist agnostic of faction politics</li>
<li>Familiar (and by extension comfortable) to many players</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cons-1">Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Often require contrivances to justify puzzles</li>
<li>Seldom change the political landscape of a campaign once cleared
(compared to something like clearing a town of an occupying army)</li>
<li>Goals can become repetitive (i.e. an endless string of ‘go here,
retrieve this treasure’)</li>
</ul>
