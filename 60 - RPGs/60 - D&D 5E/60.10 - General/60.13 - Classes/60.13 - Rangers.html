<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="rangers">Rangers</h1>
<p>Rough and wild looking, a human stalks alone through the shadows of
trees, hunting the orcs he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm.
Clutching a shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel,
cutting down one enemy after another.</p>
<p>After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her
feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon.
Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like the
cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find the gaps
between the dragon’s thick scales.</p>
<p>Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles
high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering
instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking and
sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his bow.</p>
<p>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that shelter
the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid the
dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and empty
plains, rangers keep their unending watch.</p>
<h2 id="deadly-hunters">Deadly Hunters</h2>
<p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialise in hunting the
monsters that threaten the edges of civilisation - humanoid raiders,
rampaging beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons.
They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily
through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers
focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful
against their specific favoured foes.</p>
<p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the
ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid
does. Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasise speed,
stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with
deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>
<h2 id="independent-adventurers">Independent Adventurers</h2>
<p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a
tracker, a ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of
civilisation from the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press
in from the wild. In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or
join forces with druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent
almost to a fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs
attacks, a ranger might be the first - and possibly the last - line of
defence.</p>
<p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring,
since they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and
a hot bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about
the hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of
amusement, frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that
other adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against
civilisation's foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might
not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but
they make up for it in other ways.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-ranger">Creating a Ranger</h2>
<p>As you create your ranger character, consider the nature of the
training that gave you your particular capabilities. Did you train with
a single mentor, wandering the wilds together until you mastered the
ranger’s ways? Did you leave your apprenticeship, or was your mentor
slain - perhaps by the same kind of monster that became your favoured
enemy? Or perhaps you learned your skills as part of a band of rangers
affiliated with a druidic circle, trained in mystic paths as well as
wilderness lore. You might be self-taught, a recluse who learned combat
skills, tracking, and even a magical connection to nature through the
necessity of surviving in the wilds.</p>
<p>What’s the source of your particular hatred of a certain kind of
enemy? Did a monster kill someone you loved or destroy your home
village? Or did you see too much of the destruction these monsters cause
and commit yourself to reining in their depredations? Is your
adventuring career a continuation of your work in protecting the
borderlands, or a significant change? What made you join up with a band
of adventurers? Do you find it challenging to teach new allies the ways
of the wild, or do you welcome the relief from solitude that they
offer?</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick build</h3>
<p>You can make a ranger quickly by following these suggestions. First,
make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. (Some
rangers who focus on two-weapon fighting make Strength higher than
Dexterity.) Second, choose the outlander background.</p>

<li>A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="favoured-enemy">Favoured Enemy</h3>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying,
tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>
<p>Choose a type of favoured enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials,
constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities,
oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of
humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favoured enemies.</p>
<p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favoured
enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about
them.</p>
<p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your
choice that is spoken by your favoured enemies, if they speak one at
all.</p>
<p>You choose one additional favoured enemy, as well as an associated
language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should
reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your
adventures.</p>
<h3 id="natural-explorer">Natural Explorer</h3>
<p>You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment
and are adept at travelling and surviving in such regions. Choose one
type of favoured terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland,
mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or
Wisdom check related to your favoured terrain, your proficiency bonus is
doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.</p>
<p>While travelling for an hour or more in your favoured terrain, you
gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.</li>
<li>Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.</li>
<li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while travelling (such
as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>
<li>If you are travelling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal
pace.</li>
<li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally
would.</li>
<li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number,
their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
</ul>
<p>You choose additional favoured terrain types at 6th and 10th
level.</p>
<h3 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
speciality. Choose one of the following options.</p>
<p>You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you
later get to choose again.</p>
<h4 id="archery">Archery</h4>
<p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.</p>
<h4 id="defence">Defence</h4>
<p>While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
<h4 id="duelling">Duelling</h4>
<p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other
weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
<h4 id="two-weapon-fighting">Two-Weapon Fighting</h4>
<p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability
modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p>
<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical
essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See Spells Rules
for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the
ranger spell list.</p>
<h4 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h4>
<p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and
have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast
animal friendship using either slot.</p>
<h4 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st Level
and Higher</h4>
<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell
list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more
ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level
in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since
your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom
whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you
use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
modifier</li>
<li>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
modifier</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ranger-archetype">Ranger Archetype</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate:
Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class
description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at
7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>
<h3 id="primeval-awareness">Primeval Awareness</h3>
<p>Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger
spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1
minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the
following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within
up to 6 miles if you are in your favoured terrain): aberrations,
celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature
doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h3>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
<h3 id="lands-stride">Land’s Stride</h3>
<p>Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain
costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>
<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that
are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those
created by the entangle spell.</p>
<h3 id="hide-in-plain-sight">Hide in Plain Sight</h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage
for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and
other naturally occurring materials with which to create your
camouflage.</p>
<p>Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing
yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at
least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity
(Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking
actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must
camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>
<h3 id="vanish">Vanish</h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action
on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you
choose to leave a trail.</p>
<h3 id="feral-senses">Feral Senses</h3>
<p>At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight
creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your
inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls
against it.</p>
<p>You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within
30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you
aren’t blinded or deafened.</p>
<h3 id="foe-slayer">Foe Slayer</h3>
<p>At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies.
Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the
attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your
favoured enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the
roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>
<h3 id="ranger-archetypes">Ranger Archetypes</h3>
<p>The ideal of the ranger has classic expressions. These are detailed
below.</p>
<h4 id="hunter">Hunter</h4>
<p>Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a
bulwark between civilisation and the terrors of the wilderness. As you
walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialised techniques for fighting
the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to
towering giants and terrifying dragons.</p>
<h5 id="hunters-prey">Hunter’s Prey</h5>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your
choice.</p>
<h6 id="colossus-slayer">Colossus Slayer</h6>
<p>Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a
creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if
it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only

civilised races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and

and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means
committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal
as its companion and friend.</p>
<h5 id="rangers-companion">Ranger's Companion</h5>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your
adventures and is trained to light alongside you. Choose a beast that is
no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower
(appendix D presents statistics for the hawk, mastiff, and panther as
examples). Add your proﬁciency bonus to the beast‘s AC, attack rolls,
and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is
proﬁcient in. Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or four
times your ranger level, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on
your initiative, though it doesn't take an action unless you command it
to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no
action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it
to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you
have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself
when you command the beast to take the Attack action.</p>
<p>While travelling through your favoured terrain with only the beast,
you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</p>
<p>If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours
magically bonding with another beast that isn't hostile to you, either
