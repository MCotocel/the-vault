<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="sorcerers">Sorcerers</h1>
<p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes
the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her
foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.</p>
<p>Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms
wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a
wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a
mighty blast of lightning.</p>
<p>Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a
charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike
the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin,
unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.</p>
<p>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic
bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic
forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than
one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the
power chooses the sorcerer.</p>
<h2 id="raw-magic">Raw Magic</h2>
<p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit
with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic
that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of
dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic
storm that manifests in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some
draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation,
but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of
the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some
sorcerers can’t name the origin of their power, while others trace it to
strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of
a dryad at a baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious
spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity
of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the
maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of
reality.</p>
<p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic
lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their
spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own
inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that
power.</p>
<h2 id="unexplained-powers">Unexplained Powers</h2>
<p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer
who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with
magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power
doesn’t like to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and
it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called
on.</p>
<p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to
adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that
infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to
find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever
their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party
as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical
knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-sorcerer">Creating a Sorcerer</h2>
<p>The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer
is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you’ll choose an
origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic,
but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a
family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some
extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps
scarred as well?</p>
<p>How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you
embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is
it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did
you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you
intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you’ve been given this power
for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the
right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack
such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the
world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a
drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an
experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions.
First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by
Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the
light, prestidigitation, ray of frost, and shocking grasp cantrips,
along with the 1st-level spells shield and magic missile.</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) A light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon</li>
<li>(a) A component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>
<li>(a) A dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
<li>Two daggers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left
an indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of
magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See Spells Rules for the
general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the sorcerer
spell list.</p>
<h4 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer
spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at
higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer
table.</p>
<h4 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h4>
<p>The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You
regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a
1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning
hands using either slot.</p>
<h4 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st Level
and Higher</h4>
<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell
list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn
more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd
level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd
level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from
the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since
the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into
the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier</li>
<li>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>
<h3 id="sorcerous-origin">Sorcerous Origin</h3>
<p>Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate
magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the
end of the class description. Your choice grants you features when you
choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th. and 18th level.</p>
<h3 id="font-of-magic">Font of Magic</h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within
yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow
you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>
<h4 id="sorcery-points">Sorcery Points</h4>
<p>You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher
levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You
can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your
level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long
rest.</p>
<h4 id="flexible-casting">Flexible Casting</h4>
<p>You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or
sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other
ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.</p>
<h5 id="creating-spell-slots">Creating Spell Slots</h5>
<p>You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a
bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost
of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no
higher in level than 5th.</p>
<p>Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish
a long rest</p>

<h5 id="converting-a-spell-slot-to-sorcery-points">Converting a Spell
Slot to Sorcery Points</h5>
<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and
gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot’s level.</p>
<h3 id="metamagic">Metamagic</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your
needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice.
You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.</p>
<p>You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it,
unless otherwise noted.</p>
<h4 id="careful-spell">Careful Spell</h4>
<p>When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving
throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full
force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those
creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A
chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the
spell.</p>
<h4 id="distant-spell">Distant Spell</h4>
<p>When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.</p>
<p>When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1
sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.</p>
<h4 id="empowered-spell">Empowered Spell</h4>
<p>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of one). You must use the new rolls.</p>
<p>You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different
Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.</p>
<h4 id="extended-spell">Extended Spell</h4>
<p>When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you
can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration
of 24 hours.</p>
<h4 id="heightened-spell">Heightened Spell</h4>
<p>When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw
to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target
of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the
spell.</p>
<h4 id="quickened-spell">Quickened Spell</h4>
<p>When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can
spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for
this casting.</p>
<h4 id="subtle-spell">Subtle Spell</h4>
<p>When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it
without any somatic or verbal components.</p>
<h4 id="twinned-spell">Twinned Spell</h4>
<p>When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have
a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the
spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell
(1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).</p>
<p>To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one
creature at the spell’s current level. For example, magic missile and
scorching ray aren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb
are.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="sorcerous-restoration">Sorcerous Restoration</h3>
<p>At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you
finish a short rest.</p>
<h3 id="sorcerous-origins">Sorcerous Origins</h3>
<p>Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic.
Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two
categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.</p>
<h4 id="draconic-bloodline">Draconic Bloodline</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with
your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this
origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times
who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon
parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but
most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new
bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional
circumstance.</p>
<h5 id="dragon-ancestor">Dragon Ancestor</h5>
<p>At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The
damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain
later.</p>

</table>
<p>You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you
make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency
bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.</p>
<h5 id="draconic-resilience">Draconic Resilience</h5>
<p>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your
dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum
increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in
this class.</p>
<p>Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of
dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armour, your AC equals 13 +
your Dexterity modifier.</p>
<h5 id="elemental-affinity">Elemental Affinity</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the
type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma
modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1
hour.</p>
<h5 id="dragon-wings">Dragon Wings</h5>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings
from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You
can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until
you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
<p>You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armour unless the armour
is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your
wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.</p>
<h5 id="draconic-presence">Draconic Presence</h5>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your
dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or
frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this
power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60
feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were
casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its
turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed
(if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura
ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your
aura for 24 hours.</p>
<h4 id="wild-magic">Wild Magic</h4>
<p>Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie
the order of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of
raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the
Elemental Planes, or the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you were blessed
by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic could be
a ﬂuke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it came
to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.</p>
<h5 id="wild-magic-surge">Wild Magic Surge</h5>
<p>Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting
can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a
sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d20.
If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random
magical effect.</p>
<h5 id="tides-of-chaos">Tides of Chaos</h5>
<p>Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and
chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw. Once you do so, you must ﬁnish a long rest before you can use
this feature again.</p>
<p>Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have
you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a
sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this
feature.</p>
<h5 id="bend-luck">Bend Luck</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your
wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an
ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2
sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or
penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the
creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.</p>
<h5 id="controlled-chaos">Controlled Chaos</h5>
<p>At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your
wild magic. Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can
roll twice and use either number.</p>
<h5 id="spell-bombardment">Spell Bombardment</h5>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, the harmful energy of your spells
intensiﬁes. When you roll damage for a spell and roll the highest number
possible on any of the dice, choose one of those dice, roll it again and
add that roll to the damage. You can use the feature only once per
turn.</p>
