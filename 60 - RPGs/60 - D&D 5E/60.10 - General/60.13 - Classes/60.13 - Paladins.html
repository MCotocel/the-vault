<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="paladins">Paladins</h1>
<p>Clad in plate armour that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and
grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places
her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her
hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with
amazement.</p>
<p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly
invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its
recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an
oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realise he is there.</p>
<p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only
him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as
he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light
overcomes its hideous darkness.</p>
<p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their
oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s
altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature
spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the
dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a
source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p>
<h2 id="the-cause-of-righteousness">The Cause of Righteousness</h2>
<p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with
the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to
hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on
various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the
oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many
paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much
from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p>
<p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a
variety of weapons and armour. Even so, their martial skills are
secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and
injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent
and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-the-mundane-life">Beyond the Mundane Life</h2>
<p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life.
Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a
time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle
against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias
and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true
calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn
from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes
their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite
groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of
righteousness, not to crown and country.</p>
<p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an
ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose
than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval
forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic
balance away from oblivion.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-paladin">Creating a Paladin</h2>
<p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his
or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath
don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by
reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted
servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honour, a holy knight
in shining armour venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious
champion of the light, cherishing everything beautiful that stands
against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older
than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take
vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death
by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? The Gods of the
Multiverse section lists many deities worshipped by paladins throughout
the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith,
Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and
Heimdall.</p>
<p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear
a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did
another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you
as a squire? Or did some terrible event—the destruction of your home,
perhaps—drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred
grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all
such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your
earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if
you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your
soul.</p>
<p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of
any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice.
Consider how your alignment colours the way you pursue your holy quest
and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals.
Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might
represent standards of behaviour that you have not yet attained.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a paladin quickly by following these suggestions. First,
Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Charisma.

<ul>
<li>(a) A martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons</li>
<li>(a) Five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
<li>(a) A priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
<li>Chain mail and a holy symbol</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="divine-sense">Divine Sense</h3>
<p>The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious
odour, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an
action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end
of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or
undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know
the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you
sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for
instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any
place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the
hallow spell.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma
modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.</p>
<h3 id="lay-on-hands">Lay on Hands</h3>
<p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power
that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can
restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level ×
5.</p>
<p>As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool
to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum
amount remaining in your pool.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing
to cure the target of one disease or neutralise one poison affecting it.
You can cure multiple diseases and neutralise multiple poisons with a
single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each
one.</p>
<p>This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>
<h3 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your speciality.
Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style
option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
<h4 id="defence">Defence</h4>
<p>While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
<h4 id="duelling">Duelling</h4>
<p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other
weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.</p>
<h4 id="great-weapon-fighting">Great Weapon Fighting</h4>
<p>When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a
melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the
die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or
versatile property for you to gain this benefit.</p>
<h4 id="protection">Protection</h4>
<p>When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is
within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage
on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.</p>
<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through
meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See Spells Rules
for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the
paladin spell list.</p>
<h4 id="preparing-and-casting-spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
<p>The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or
higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You
regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to
cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a
number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your
paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be
of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level
and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of
prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can
cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in
prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell
on your list.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since
their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier</li>
</ul>
<p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>
<h3 id="divine-smite">Divine Smite</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon
attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the
target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for
a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st,
to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an
undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>
<h3 id="divine-health">Divine Health</h3>
<p>By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune
to disease.</p>
<h3 id="sacred-oath">Sacred Oath</h3>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a
paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage,
committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath
of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all
detailed at the end of the class description.</p>
<p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th. 15th.
and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel
Divinity feature.</p>
<h4 id="oath-spells">Oath Spells</h4>
<p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these
spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain
access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t
count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
<p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell
list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>
<h4 id="channel-divinity">Channel Divinity</h4>
<p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical
effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how
to use it.</p>
<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use.
You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
again.</p>
<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use
such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save
DC.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h3>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
<h3 id="aura-of-protection">Aura of Protection</h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10
feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the
saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of
+1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
<h3 id="aura-of-courage">Aura of Courage</h3>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of
you can’t be frightened while you are conscious.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
<h3 id="improved-divine-smite">Improved Divine Smite</h3>
<p>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your
melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a
creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant
damage.</p>
<h3 id="cleansing-touch">Cleansing Touch</h3>
<p>Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on
yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>
<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a
long rest.</p>
<h3 id="aura-improvements">Aura Improvements</h3>
<p>At 18th level, the range of your auras increase to 30 feet.</p>
<h3 id="sacred-oaths">Sacred Oaths</h3>
<p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to
the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The
final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination
of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t
consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and
made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a
formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the
paladin’s heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Breaking your oath A paladin tries to hold to the highest
standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible.
Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation
calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion
causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>
<p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a
cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same
order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as a sign of
penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a
rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>
<p>If a paladin wilfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of
repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM’s
discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class
and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option
that appears in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="oath-of-devotion">Oath of Devotion</h4>
<p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of
justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights,
or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining
armour, acting with honour in pursuit of justice and the greater good.
They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for
better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many
who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their
gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels - the
perfect servants of good - as their ideals, and incorporate images of
angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>
<h5 id="tenets-of-devotion">Tenets of Devotion</h5>
<p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary,
paladins of this oath share these tenets.</p>
<h6 id="honesty">Honesty</h6>

<h6 id="courage">Courage</h6>
<p>Never fear to act, though caution is wise.</p>
<h6 id="compassion">Compassion</h6>
<p>Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them.
Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.</p>
<h6 id="honour">Honour</h6>
<p>Treat others with fairness, and let your honourable deeds be an
example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least
amount of harm.</p>
<h6 id="duty">Duty</h6>

entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over
you.</p>

<h5 id="channel-divinity-1">Channel Divinity</h5>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two
Channel Divinity options.</p>
<h6 id="sacred-weapon">Sacred Weapon</h6>
<p>As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with
positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your
Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum
bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and
dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it
becomes magical for the duration.</p>
<p>You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If
you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall
unconscious, this effect ends.</p>
<h6 id="turn-the-unholy">Turn the Unholy</h6>
<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or
undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1
minute or until it takes damage.</p>
<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30
feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it
from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action.</p>
<h5 id="aura-of-devotion">Aura of Devotion</h5>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of
you can’t be charmed while you are conscious.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
<h5 id="purity-of-spirit">Purity of Spirit</h5>
<p>Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a
<em>protection from evil and good</em> spell.</p>
<h5 id="holy-nimbus">Holy Nimbus</h5>
<p>At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For
1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim
light shines 30 feet beyond that.</p>
<p>Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the
creature takes 10 radiant damage.</p>
<p>In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws
against spells cast by fiends or undead.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
long rest.</p>
<h4 id="oath-of-the-ancients">Oath of the Ancients</h4>
<p>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the
rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or
horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the
side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they
love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily
because they believe in principles of honour, courage, and justice. They
adorn their armour and clothing with images of growing things - leaves,
antlers, or flowers - to reﬂect their commitment to preserving life and
light in the world.</p>
<h5 id="tenets-of-the-ancients">Tenets of the Ancients</h5>
<p>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for
uncounted centuries. This oath emphasises the principles of good above
any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are
simple.</p>
<h6 id="kindle-the-light">Kindle the Light</h6>
<p>Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the
light of hope in the world, beating back despair.</p>
<h6 id="shelter-the-light">Shelter the Light</h6>
<p>Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand
against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life ﬂourishes,
stand against the forces that would render it barren.</p>
<h6 id="preserve-your-own-light">Preserve Your Own Light</h6>
<p>Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the
light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.</p>
<h6 id="be-the-light">Be the Light</h6>
<p>Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of
your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</p>

<h5 id="channel-divinity-2">Channel Divinity</h5>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two
Channel Divinity options</p>
<h6 id="natures-wrath">Nature's Wrath</h6>
<p>You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to
ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up
and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The
creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its
choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature
repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success,
it frees itself and the vines vanish.</p>
<h6 id="turn-the-faithless">Turn the Faithless</h6>
<p>You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are
painful for fey and ﬁends to hear. As an action, you present your holy
symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you
must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>
<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30
feet of you. It also can‘t take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it
from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action.</p>
<p>If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion,
shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is
turned.</p>
<h5 id="aura-of-warding">Aura of Warding</h5>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that
it forms an eldritch ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of
you have resistance to damage from spells.</p>
<p>At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>
<h5 id="undying-sentinel">Undying Sentinel</h5>
<p>Starting at 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points and are
not killed outright, you can choose to drop to 1 hit point instead. Once
you use this ability, you can't use it again until you ﬁnish a long
rest. Additionally, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you
can't be aged magically.</p>
<h5 id="elder-champion">Elder Champion</h5>
<p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an ancient force of nature,
taking on an appearance you choose. For example, your skin might turn
green or take on a bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or
moss-like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane.</p>
<p>Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 minute, you
gain the following beneﬁts:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.</li>
<li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1
action, you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</li>
<li>Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving
throws against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you use this feature. you can't use it again until you ﬁnish a
long rest.</p>
<h4 id="oath-of-vengeance">Oath of Vengeance</h4>
<p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have
committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless Villagers,
when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a
thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages
through the countryside - at times like these, paladins arise and swear
an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these
paladins - sometimes called avengers or dark knights - their own purity
is not as important as delivering justice.</p>
<h5 id="tenets-of-vengeance">Tenets of Vengeance</h5>
<p>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the
tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary.
Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacriﬁce even their own
righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the
paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core
principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</p>
<h6 id="fight-the-greater-evil">Fight the Greater Evil</h6>
<p>Faced with a choice of ﬁghting my sworn foes or combating a lesser
evil, I choose the greater evil.</p>
<h6 id="no-mercy-for-the-wicked">No Mercy for the Wicked</h6>
<p>Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</p>
<h6 id="by-any-means-necessary">By Any Means Necessary</h6>
<p>My qualms can‘t get in the way of exterminating my foes.</p>
<h6 id="restitution">Restitution</h6>
<p>If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop
them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</p>

<h6 id="channel-divinity-3">Channel Divinity</h6>
<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level. you gain the following two
Channel Divinity options.</p>
<h6 id="abjure-enemy">Abjure Enemy</h6>
<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of
denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60
feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have
disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
<p>On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it
takes any damage. While frightened, the creature's speed is 0, and it
can't beneﬁt from any bonus to its speed.</p>
<p>On a successful save, the creature's speed is halved for 1 minute or
until the creature takes any damage.</p>
<h6 id="vow-of-enmity">Vow of Enmity</h6>
<p>As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature
you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain
advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it
drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.</p>
<h5 id="relentless-avenger">Relentless Avenger</h5>
<p>By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's
retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can
move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of
the same reaction. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity
attacks.</p>
<h5 id="soul-of-vengeance">Soul of Vengeance</h5>
<p>Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow
of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe, When a creature under
the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your
reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is
within range.</p>
<h5 id="avenging-angel">Avenging Angel</h5>
<p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using
your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the
following beneﬁts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a ﬂying speed of 60
feet.</li>
<li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The ﬁrst time any
enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle,
the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against
the frightened creature have advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you use this feature. you can't use it again until you ﬁnish a
long rest.</p>
