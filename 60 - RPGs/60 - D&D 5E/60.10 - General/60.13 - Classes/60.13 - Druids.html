<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="druids">Druids</h1>
<p>Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the
fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite
the torch-carrying orcs who threaten her forest.</p>
<p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a
leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of
a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists’
activities.</p>
<p>Swinging a blade formed of pure fire, a half-elf charges into a mass
of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul
creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p>
<p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the
creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s
resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature.
Instead, they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable
will.</p>
<h2 id="power-of-nature">Power of Nature</h2>
<p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other
magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature
deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union
with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve
gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic
traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the
worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p>
<p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of
tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the
ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study
of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to
their natural form.</p>
<h2 id="preserve-the-balance">Preserve the Balance</h2>
<p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements
that make up a world—air, earth, fire, and water—must remain in
equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the
world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and
broken apart into its component elements. Thus, druids oppose cults of
Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of
others.</p>
<p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that
sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilised folk to live
in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that
which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural,
including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead
(such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such
creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids’
territory.</p>
<p>Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions
of unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening
nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active
role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-druid">Creating a Druid</h2>
<p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close
bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the
Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned
in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic
encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to face with a giant
eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character
was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was
interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s
destiny.</p>
<p>Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling,
or did you first spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring?
Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil, and you took up an
adventuring life in hopes of finding a new home or purpose.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a druid quickly by following these suggestions. First,
Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.
Second, choose the hermit background.</p>

<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) A wooden shield or (b) any simple weapon</li>
<li>(a) A scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon</li>
<li>Leather armour, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="druidic">Druidic</h3>
<p>You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the
language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know
this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the
message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but
can’t decipher it without magic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Sacred plants and wood A druid holds certain plants to be
sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper,
mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as
part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or
sprigs of mistletoe.</p>
<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as
weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon
handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is
associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent
hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as
shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown
weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>
<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen
other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert
region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells
to shape that essence to your will. See Spells Rules for the general
rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the druid spell
list.</p>
<h4 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid
spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher
levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>
<h4 id="preparing-and-casting-spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
<p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells,
you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to
cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a
number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level
(minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.</p>
<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level
and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of
prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can
cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
<p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a
long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in
prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell
on your list.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your
magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
modifier</li>
<li>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
modifier</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ritual-casting">Ritual Casting</h4>
<p>You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use a druidic focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
spellcasting focus for your druid spells.</p>
<h3 id="wild-shape">Wild Shape</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume
the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature
twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long
rest.</p>
<p>Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as
shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can
transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower
that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.</p>

</table>
<p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half
your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form
unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your
normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You
automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or
die.</p>
<p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast,
but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw
proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block
is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the
creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>
<li>When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice.
When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit
points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a
result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and
have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the
excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you
aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>
<li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action
that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already
cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a
spell, such as call lightning, that you’ve already cast.</li>
<li>You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or
other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of
doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as
darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
<li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space,
merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as
normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to
wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your
equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any
equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or
merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until
you leave the form.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="druid-circle">Druid Circle</h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the
Circle of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end
of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level
and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>
<h3 id="wild-shape-improvement">Wild Shape Improvement</h3>
<p>At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape
of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
that doesn't have a flying speed. You can use this feature twice. You
regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="wild-shape-improvement-1">Wild Shape Improvement</h3>
<p>At 8th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape
of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1 or lower. You
can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a
short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="timeless-body">Timeless Body</h3>
<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to
age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1
year.</p>
<h3 id="beast-spells">Beast Spells</h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in
any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and
verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you
aren’t able to provide material components.</p>
<h3 id="archdruid">Archdruid</h3>
<p>At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of
times.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of
your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost
and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your
normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.</p>
<h3 id="druid-circles">Druid Circles</h3>
<p>Though their organisation is invisible to most outsiders, druids are
part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All
druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some
individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking
members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids
recognise each other as brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the
wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each
other.</p>
<p>At a local scale, druids are organised into circles that share
certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.</p>
<h4 id="circle-of-the-land">Circle of the Land</h4>
<p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard
ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids
meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal
secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief
priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisers
to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is
influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s
mysterious rites.</p>
<h5 id="bonus-cantrip">Bonus Cantrip</h5>
<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional
druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn’t count against the
number of druid cantrips you know.</p>
<h5 id="natural-recovery">Natural Recovery</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by
sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest,
you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You
can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to
two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot
or two 1st-level slots.</p>
<h5 id="circle-spells">Circle Spells</h5>
<p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to
cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to
circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose
that land - arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp,
or Underdark - and consult the associated list of spells.</p>
<p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared,
and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each
day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid
spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

<h5 id="lands-stride">Land’s Stride</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain
costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>
<p>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that
are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those
created by the entangle spell.</p>
<h5 id="natures-ward">Nature’s Ward</h5>
<p>When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by
elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.</p>
<h5 id="natures-sanctuary">Nature’s Sanctuary</h5>
<p>When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your
connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or
plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a
successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</p>
<p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack
against you.</p>
<h4 id="circle-of-the-moon">Circle of the Moon</h4>
<p>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are ﬁerce guardians of the wilds.
Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade
warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they
might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid
creature, let alone another druid.</p>
<p>Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great
eat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and
crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing
monster. The wild is in the druid‘s blood.</p>
<h5 id="combat-wild-shape">Combat Wild Shape</h5>
<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use
Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.</p>
<p>Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a
bonus action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level
of the spell slot expended.</p>
<h5 id="circle-forms">Circle Forms</h5>
<p>The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more
dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild
Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1
(you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide
by the other limitations there).</p>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast with a
challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded
down.</p>
<h5 id="primal-strike">Primal Strike</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as magical
for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
attacks and damage.</p>
<h5 id="elemental-wild-shape">Elemental Wild Shape</h5>
<p>At 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time
to transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a ﬁre elemental,
or a water elemental.</p>
<h5 id="thousand-forms">Thousand Forms</h5>
<p>By 14th level, you have learned to use magic to alter your physical
form in more subtle ways. You can cast the alter self spell at will.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Druids and the gods Some druids venerate the forces of nature
themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature
deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B
include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often
considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and
urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith
is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers,
foresters, fishers, and others who live closely with nature. This
tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond
personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth
Mother, as well as devotees of Obad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.</p>
<p>In the worlds of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles
are not usually connected to the faith of a single nature deity. Any
given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids
who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods
of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often
called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids
count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy of veneration.</p>
<p>The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected
to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions of
the world. They believe that every living thing and every natural
phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit.
Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these
spirits. Different druidic sects, though, hold different philosophies
about the proper relationship of these spirits to each other and to the
forces of civilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane
magic is an abomination against nature, the Children of Winter venerate
the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions
meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.</p>
