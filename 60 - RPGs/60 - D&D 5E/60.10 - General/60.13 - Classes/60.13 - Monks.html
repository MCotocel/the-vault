<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="monks">Monks</h1>
<p>Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a
half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed
ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking
their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands
alone.</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a
battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a
blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.</p>
<p>Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps
into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a
balcony a stone’s throw away. She slides her blade free of its
cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant
prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.</p>
<p>Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to
magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether
channelled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of
defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk
does.</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-of-ki">The Magic of Ki</h2>
<p>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic
traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses
the multiverse - specifically, the element that flows through living
bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical
effects and exceed their bodies’ physical capabilities, and some of
their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents.
Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their
unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and
their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the
bodies of their foes.</p>
<h2 id="training-and-asceticism">Training and Asceticism</h2>
<p>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D,
tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand
still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through
contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as
children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t
be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks
had performed for their families.</p>
<p>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population,
secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress.
Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or
assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other
mortal or divine power.</p>
<p>The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbours, making frequent
visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food
and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting
their neighbours from monsters or tyrants.</p>
<p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured,
communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition,
and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters
take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal
tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care
little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a
greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their
treasure.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-monk">Creating a Monk</h2>
<p>As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the
monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years.
Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did
your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service
performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a
crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for
yourself?</p>
<p>Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for
a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were
cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you
dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to
accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your
home?</p>
<p>As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the
discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in
alignment.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First,
make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second,
choose the hermit background.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="equipment">Equipment</h4>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) A shortsword or (b) any simple weapon</li>
<li>(a) A dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
<li>10 darts</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unarmoured-defence">Unarmoured Defence</h3>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armour and not
wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your
Wisdom modifier.</p>
<h3 id="martial-arts">Martial Arts</h3>
<p>At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of
combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are
shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed
or heavy property.</p>
<p>You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding
only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armour or wielding a
shield:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>
<li>You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed
strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as
shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>
<li>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk
weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.
For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a
quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action,
assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain monasteries use specialised forms of the monk weapons. For
example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a
short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter
blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can
use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the Weapons
section.</p>
<h3 id="ki">Ki</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic
energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of
ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as
shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>
<p>You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start
knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defence, and Step
of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this
class.</p>
<p>When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short
or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back
into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating
to regain your ki points.</p>
<p>Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw
to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="flurry-of-blows">Flurry of Blows</h4>
<p>Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can
spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>
<h4 id="patient-defence">Patient Defence</h4>
<p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action
on your turn.</p>
<h4 id="step-of-the-wind">Step of the Wind</h4>
<p>You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a
bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the
turn.</p>
<h3 id="unarmoured-movement">Unarmoured Movement</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are
not wearing armour or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you
reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>
<p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces
and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>
<h3 id="monastic-tradition">Monastic Tradition</h3>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic
tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of
the Four Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description.
Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th,
and 17th level.</p>
<h3 id="deflect-missiles">Deflect Missiles</h3>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch
the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so,
the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your monk level.</p>
<p>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is
small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand
free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to
make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just
caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with
proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile
counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20
feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="slow-fall">Slow Fall</h3>
<p>Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to
reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your
monk level.</p>
<h3 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h3>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
<h3 id="stunning-strike">Stunning Strike</h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an
opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon
attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The
target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until
the end of your next turn.</p>
<h3 id="ki-empowered-strikes">Ki-Empowered Strikes</h3>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
damage.</p>
<h3 id="unarmoured-movement-1">Unarmoured Movement</h3>
<p>At 6th level, your Unarmoured Speed speed bonus increases to 15 feet
while you are not wearing armour or wielding a shield.</p>
<h3 id="evasion">Evasion</h3>
<p>At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way
of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a
fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take
no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if
you fail.</p>
<h3 id="stillness-of-mind">Stillness of Mind</h3>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on
yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.</p>
<h3 id="unarmoured-movement-improvement">Unarmoured Movement
Improvement</h3>
<p>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces
and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>
<h3 id="purity-of-body">Purity of Body</h3>
<p>At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you
immune to disease and poison.</p>
<h3 id="unarmoured-movement-2">Unarmoured Movement</h3>
<p>At 10th level, your Unarmoured Speed speed bonus increases to 20 feet
while you are not wearing armour or wielding a shield.</p>
<h3 id="tongue-of-the-sun-and-moon">Tongue of the Sun and Moon</h3>
<p>Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so
that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that
can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>
<h3 id="diamond-soul">Diamond Soul</h3>
<p>Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in
all saving throws.</p>
<p>Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can
spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>
<h3 id="unarmoured-movement-3">Unarmoured Movement</h3>
<p>At 14th level, your Unarmoured Speed speed bonus increases to 25 feet
while you are not wearing armour or wielding a shield.</p>
<h3 id="timeless-body">Timeless Body</h3>
<p>At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the
frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die
of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.</p>
<h3 id="empty-body">Empty Body</h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points
to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have
resistance to all damage but force damage.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection
spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t
take any other creatures with you.</p>
<h3 id="unarmoured-movement-4">Unarmoured Movement</h3>
<p>At 18th level, your Unarmoured Speed speed bonus increases to 30 feet
while you are not wearing armour or wielding a shield.</p>
<h3 id="perfect-self">Perfect Self</h3>
<p>At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points
remaining, you regain 4 ki points.</p>
<h3 id="monastic-traditions">Monastic Traditions</h3>
<p>Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries
scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition
exclusively, but a few honour the three traditions and instruct each
monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions
rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more
adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd
level.</p>
<h4 id="way-of-the-open-hand">Way of the Open Hand</h4>
<p>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial
arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and
trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and
practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.</p>
<h5 id="open-hand-technique">Open Hand Technique</h5>
<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can
manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a
creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you
can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked
prone.</li>
<li>It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it
up to 15 feet away from you.</li>
<li>It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="wholeness-of-body">Wholeness of Body</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action,
you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must
finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>
<h5 id="tranquillity">Tranquillity</h5>
<p>Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that
surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain
the effect of a sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next
long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for
the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>
<h5 id="quivering-palm">Quivering Palm</h5>
<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in
someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can
spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last
for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are
harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the
target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action,
the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is
reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic
damage.</p>
<p>You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a
time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an
action.</p>
<h4 id="way-of-shadow">Way of Shadow</h4>
<p>Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and
subterfuge. These monks might be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and
they serve as spies and assassins. Sometimes the members of a ninja
monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about
their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves'
guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone
else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their methods, the heads of
these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience of their
students.</p>
<h5 id="shadow-arts">Shadow Arts</h5>
<p>Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can use
your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As an action, you
can spend 2 ki points to cast <em>darkness</em>, <em>darkvision</em>,
<em>pass without trace</em>, or <em>silence</em>, without providing
material components. Additionally, you gain the minor illusion cantrip
if you don't already know it.</p>
<h5 id="shadow-step">Shadow Step</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to step from one shadow into
another. When you are in dim light or darkness, as a bonus action you
can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is
also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the ﬁrst melee
attack you make before the end of the turn.</p>
<h5 id="cloak-of-shadows">Cloak of Shadows</h5>
<p>By 11th level, you have learned to become one with the shadows. When
you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to
become invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a
spell, or are in an area of bright light.</p>
<h5 id="opportunist">Opportunist</h5>
<p>At 17th level, you can exploit a creature's momentary distraction
when it is hit by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is
hit by an attack made by a creature other than you, you can use your
reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.</p>
<h4 id="way-of-the-four-elements">Way of the Four Elements</h4>
<p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the
elements. When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces
of creation and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an
extension of your body. Some members of this tradition dedicate
themselves to a single element, but others weave the elements together.
Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of
their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as
phoenixes, ﬁsh, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.</p>
<h5 id="disciple-of-the-elements">Disciple of the Elements</h5>
<p>When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you learn magical
disciplines that harness the power of the four elements. A discipline
requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.</p>
<p>You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental
discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the “Elemental
Disciplines" section below. You learn one additional elemental
discipline of your choice at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>
<p>Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace
one elemental discipline that you already know with a different
discipline.</p>
<h6 id="casting-elemental-spells">Casting Elemental Spells</h6>
<p>Some elemental disciplines allow you to cast spells. See chapter 10
for the general rules of spellcasting. To cast one of these spells, you
use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide
material components for it.</p>
<p>Once you reach 5th level in this class, you can spend additional ki
points to increase the level of an elemental discipline spell that you
cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level,
as burning hands does. The spell‘s level increases by 1 for each
additional ki point you spend. For example. if you are a 5th-level monk
and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki
points to cast it as a 2nd-level spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2
ki points plus 1).</p>
<p>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this
way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you
spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown
in the Spells and Ki Points table.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Monastic Orders The worlds of D&amp;D contain a multitude of
monasteries and monastic traditions. In lands with an Asian cultural
ﬂavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east of the Forgotten Realms, these
monasteries are associated with philosophical traditions and martial
arts practice. The Iron Hand School, the Five Stars School, the Northern
Fist School, and the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different
approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines of the
monk. Some of these monasteries have spread to the western lands of
Faerun, particularly in places with large Shou immigrant communities,
such as Thesk and Westgate.</p>
<p>Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who teach the
value of physical excellence and mental discipline. In the Forgotten
Realms, the order of the Dark Moon is made up of monks dedicated to Shar
(goddess of loss), who maintain secret communities in remote hills, back
allies, and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries of Ilmater (god of
endurance) are named after ﬂowers, and their orders carry the names of
great heroes of the faith: the Disciples of Saint Sollars the
Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose near Damara.
The monasteries of Eberron combine the study of martial arts with a life
of scholarship. Most are devoted to the deities of the Sovereign Host.
In the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to Majere, god of
meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, many monasteries are dedicated to
Xan Yae, the goddess of twilight and the superiority of mind over
matter, or to Zuoken, god of mental and physical mastery.</p>
<p>The evil monks of the Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of Greyhawk
derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god but from dedication
to the principles of their nation and their race - the belief that the
Suel strand of humanity are meant to rule the world.</p>
