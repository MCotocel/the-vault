<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="wizards">Wizards</h1>
<p>Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her
eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her
quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell
and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts
into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.</p>
<p>Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic
circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron
along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he
drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle,
bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.</p>
<p>Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a
handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few
words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more
clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage
to his left.</p>
<p>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the
spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates
the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning,
subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures
monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns
slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance
into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other
worlds.</p>
<h2 id="scholars-of-the-arcane">Scholars of the Arcane</h2>
<p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic
draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become
like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical
spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting
gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these
surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of
apprenticeship and countless hours of study.</p>
<p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary.
They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They
can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or
inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are
steeped in magic.</p>
<h2 id="the-lure-of-knowledge">The Lure of Knowledge</h2>
<p>Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to
come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library
or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other
wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or
pursue lives of crime or domination.</p>
<p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous
wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into
crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their
counterparts in ancient civilisations knew secrets of magic that have
been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the
path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-wizard">Creating a Wizard</h2>
<p>Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least
one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact
with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have
a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly?
Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you
the basics of magic?</p>
<p>What drew you forth from your life of study? Did your first taste of
magical knowledge leave you hungry for more? Have you received word of a
secret repository of knowledge not yet plundered by any other wizard?
Perhaps you’re simply eager to put your newfound magical skills to the
test in the face of danger.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a wizard quickly by following these suggestions. First,
Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by
Constitution or Dexterity. If you plan to join the School of
Enchantment, make Charisma your next-best score. Second, choose the sage
background. Third, choose the mage hand, light, and ray of frost
cantrips, along with the following 1st-level spells for your spellbook:
burning hands, charm person, feather fall, mage armour, magic missile,
and sleep.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) A quarterstaff or (b) a dagger</li>
<li>(a) A component pouch or (b) an arcane focus</li>
<li>(a) A scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
<li>A spellbook</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells
that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See Spells Rules for
the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the wizard
spell list.</p>
<h3 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h3>
<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard
spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at
higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard
table.</p>
<h3 id="spellbook">Spellbook</h3>
<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard
spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard
spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>
<h4 id="preparing-and-casting-spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to
cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook
equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one
spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level
and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of
prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level
slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared
spells.</p>
<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying
your spellbook and memorising the incantations and gestures you must
make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell
on your list.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,
since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorisation.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier</li>
<li>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ritual-casting">Ritual Casting</h4>
<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the
spell prepared.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
<h4 id="learning-spells-of-1st-level-and-higher">Learning Spells of 1st
Level and Higher</h4>
<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of
your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of
a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On
your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your
spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Your Spellbook</p>
<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect
the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual
breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might
find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell
recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a
dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>
<h4 id="copying-a-spell-into-the-book">Copying a Spell into the
Book</h4>
<p>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it
to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you
can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>
<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic
form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used
by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you
understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your
spellbook using your own notation.</p>
<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50
GP. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment
with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record
it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell
just like your other spells.</p>
<h4 id="replacing-the-book">Replacing the Book</h4>
<p>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for
example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is
just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and
easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to
cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of
the copied spell.</p>
<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to
transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.
Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new
spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup
spellbooks in a safe place.</p>
<h4 id="the-books-appearance">The Book’s Appearance</h4>
<p>Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own
decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional
leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely
bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose
collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous
spellbook in a mishap.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="arcane-recovery">Arcane Recovery</h3>
<p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying
your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can
choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two
levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell
slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>
<h3 id="arcane-tradition">Arcane Tradition</h3>
<p>When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping
your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration,
Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy,
or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.</p>
<p>Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th,
and 14th level.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="spell-mastery">Spell Mastery</h3>
<p>At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells
that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a
2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those
spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level,
you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>
<p>By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the
spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>
<h3 id="signature-spells">Signature Spells</h3>
<p>When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells
and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells
in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells
prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have
prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without
expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you
finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a
spell slot as normal.</p>
<h3 id="arcane-traditions">Arcane Traditions</h3>
<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest
mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of
D&amp;D, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>
<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around
the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have catalogued thousands
of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools, as
described in chapter 10. In some places, these traditions are literally
schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another
studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions,
the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties
competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices
in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into
schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require
mastery of different techniques.</p>
<h4 id="school-of-abjuration">School of Abjuration</h4>
<p>The School of Abjuration emphasises magic that blocks, banishes, or
protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about
denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand,
however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing
evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and
respected vocation.</p>
<p>Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful
spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded
against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence
must be closed.</p>
<h5 id="abjuration-savant">Abjuration Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h5 id="arcane-ward">Arcane Ward</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can weave magic around yourself for
protection. When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher,
you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a
magical ward on yourself that lasts until you finish a long rest. The
ward has a hit point maximum equal to twice your wizard level + your
Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the
damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you
take any remaining damage.</p>
<p>While the ward has 0 hit points, it can't absorb damage, but its
magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or
higher, the ward regains a number of hit points equal to twice the level
of the spell.</p>
<p>Once you create the ward, you can't create it again until you finish
a long rest.</p>
<h5 id="protected-ward">Protected Ward</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when a creature that you can see within 30
feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane
Ward to absorb that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit
points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage</p>
<h5 id="improved-abjuration">Improved Abjuration</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, when you cast an abjuration spell that
requires you to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell
(as in counterspell and dispel magic), you add your proficiency bonus to
that ability check.</p>
<h5 id="spell-resistance">Spell Resistance</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you have advantage on saving throws against
spells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you have resistance against the damage of spells.</p>
<h4 id="school-of-conjuration">School of Conjuration</h4>
<p>As a conjurer, you favour spells that produce objects and creatures
out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or
summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery
grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself
across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an
instant.</p>
<h5 id="conjuration-savant">Conjuration Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy a conjuration spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h5 id="minor-conjuration">Minor Conjuration</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can use your
action to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground
in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of you. This
object can be no larger than 3 feet on a side and weigh no more than 10
pounds, and its form must be that of a nonmagical object that you have
seen. The object is visibly magical, radiating dim light out to 5
feet.</p>
<p>The object disappears after 1 hour, when you use this feature again,
if it takes any damage, or if it deals any damage.</p>
<h5 id="benign-transposition">Benign Transposition</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can use your action to teleport up to 30
feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. Alternatively, you can
choose a space within range that is occupied by a Small or Medium
creature. If that creature is willing, you both teleport, swapping
places.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher.</p>
<h5 id="focused-conjuration">Focused Conjuration</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, while you are concentrating on a conjuration
spell, your concentration can't be broken as a result of taking
damage.</p>
<h5 id="durable-summons">Durable Summons</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, any creature that you summon or create with a
conjuration spell has 30 temporary hit points.</p>
<h4 id="school-of-divination">School of Divination</h4>
<p>The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike,
for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future.
As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and
consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of
discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.</p>
<h5 id="divination-savant">Divination Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy a divination spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h5 id="portent">Portent</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, glimpses of the
future begin to press in on your awareness. When you finish a long rest,
roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack
roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature that you
can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so
before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per
turn.</p>
<p>Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a long
rest, you lose any unused foretelling rolls.</p>
<h5 id="expert-divination">Expert Divination</h5>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, casting divination spells comes so easily to
you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When
you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot,
you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a
level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th
level.</p>
<h5 id="the-third-eye">The Third Eye</h5>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can use your action to increase your
powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following
benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or
long rest. You can't use the feature again until you finish a rest.</p>
<h6 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h6>
<p>You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</p>
<h6 id="ethereal-sight">Ethereal Sight</h6>
<p>You can see into the Ethereal Plane within 60 feet of you.</p>
<h6 id="greater-comprehension">Greater Comprehension</h6>
<p>You can read any language.</p>
<h6 id="see-invisibility">See Invisibility</h6>
<p>You can see invisible creatures and objects within 10 feet of you
that are within line of sight.</p>
<h5 id="greater-portent">Greater Portent</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, the visions in your dreams intensify and
paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. You roll
three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two.</p>
<h4 id="school-of-enchantment">School of Enchantment</h4>
<p>As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability
to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some
enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their
arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who
magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall
somewhere in between.</p>
<h5 id="enchantment-savant">Enchantment Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy an enchantment spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h5 id="hypnotic-gaze">Hypnotic Gaze</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, your soft words
and enchanting gaze can magically enthral another creature. As an
action, choose one creature that you can see within 5 feet of you. If
the target can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
against your wizard spell save DC or be charmed by you until the end of
your next turn. The charmed creature's speed drops to 0, and the
creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.</p>
<p>On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect,
extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the
effect ends if you move more than 5 feet away from the creature, if the
creature can neither see nor hear you, or if the creature takes
damage.</p>
<p>Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial
saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature on that
creature again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h5 id="instinctive-charm">Instinctive Charm</h5>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of
you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to
divert the attack, provided that another creature is within the attack's
range. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw against your wizard
spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker must target the creature
that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple
creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target. On a
successful save, you can't use this feature on the attacker again until
you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack
hits or misses. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this
effect.</p>
<h5 id="split-enchantment">Split Enchantment</h5>
<p>Starting at 10th level, when you cast an enchantment spell of 1st
level or higher that targets only one creature, you can have it target a
second creature.</p>
<h5 id="alter-memories">Alter Memories</h5>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to make a creature unaware of
your magical influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to
charm one or more creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding
so that it remains unaware of being charmed.</p>
<p>Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action
to try to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent
charmed. The creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw
against your wizard spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its
memories equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You can
make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time can't exceed
the duration of your enchantment spell.</p>
<h4 id="school-of-evocation">School of Evocation</h4>
<p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects
such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling
lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military
forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use
their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own
gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>
<h5 id="evocation-savant">Evocation Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h5 id="sculpt-spells">Sculpt Spells</h5>
<p>Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety
within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation
spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a
number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they
take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful
save.</p>
<h5 id="potent-cantrip">Potent Cantrip</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures
that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving
throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cant</p>
<h5 id="empowered-evocation">Empowered Evocation</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to
one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>
<h5 id="overchannel">Overchannel</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler
spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th-level that deals
damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</p>
<p>The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use
this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic
damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each
time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the
necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores
resistance and immunity.</p>
<h4 id="school-of-illusion">School of Illusion</h4>
<p>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles
the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the
illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some
illusionists - including many gnome wizards - are benign tricksters who
use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of
deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their
personal gain.</p>
<h5 id="illusion-savant">Illusion Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h5 id="improved-minor-illusion">Improved Minor Illusion</h5>
<p>When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the minor
illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a
different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count
against your number of cantrips known.</p>
<p>When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a sound and an
image with a single casting of the spell.</p>
<h5 id="malleable-illusions">Malleable Illusions</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, when you cast an illusion spell that has a
duration of 1 minute or longer, you can use your action to change the
nature of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the
illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.</p>
<h5 id="illusory-self">Illusory Self</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can create an illusory duplicate of
yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger. When a
creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to
interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The
attack automatically misses you, then the illusion dissipates.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="illusory-reality">Illusory Reality</h5>
<p>By 14th level, you have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic
into your illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an
illusion spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one inanimate,
nonmagical object that is part of the illusion and make that object
real. You can do this on your turn as a bonus action while the spell is
ongoing. The object remains real for 1 minute. For example, you can
create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long
enough for your allies to cross.</p>
<p>The object can't deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</p>
<h4 id="school-of-necromancy">School of Necromancy</h4>
<p>The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death,
and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to
manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress,
you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys
its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can
manipulate.</p>
<p>Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to
the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the
forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.</p>
<h5 id="necromancy-savant">Necromancy Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy a necromancy spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h5 id="grim-harvest">Grim Harvest</h5>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures
you kill with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more
creatures with a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points
equal to twice the spell's level, or three times its level if the spell
belongs to the School of Necromancy. You don't gain this benefit for
killing constructs or undead.</p>
<h5 id="undead-thralls">Undead Thralls</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you add the animate dead spell to your spellbook if it
is not there already. When you cast animate dead, you can target one
additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton,
as appropriate.</p>
<p>Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has
additional benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to
your wizard level.</li>
<li>The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage
rolls.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="inured-to-undeath">Inured to Undeath</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and
your hit point maximum can't be reduced. You have spent so much time
dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have
become inured to some of their worst effects.</p>
<h5 id="command-undead">Command Undead</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use magic to bring undead under your
control, even those created by other wizards. As an action, you can
choose one undead that you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature
must make a Charisma saving throw against your wizard spell save DC. If
it succeeds, you can't use this feature on it again. If it fails, it
becomes friendly to you and obeys your commands until you use this
feature again.</p>
<p>Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target
has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving
throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an Intelligence of 12 or
higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour until it
succeeds and breaks free.</p>
<h4 id="school-of-transmutation">School of Transmutation</h4>
<p>You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you,
the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight
in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and
learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic
gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.</p>
<p>Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into
toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit.
Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the
power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</p>
<h5 id="transmutation-savant">Transmutation Savant</h5>
<p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy a transmutation spell into your spellbook is
halved.</p>
<h5 id="minor-alchemy">Minor Alchemy</h5>
<p>Starting at 2nd level when you select this school, you can
temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object,
changing it from one substance into another. You perform a special
alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood, stone (but
not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a
different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes you spend
performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of
material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you
were concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original
substance.</p>
<h5 id="transmuters-stone">Transmuter's Stone</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter's
stone that stores transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone
yourself or give it to another creature. A creature gains a benefit of
your choice as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When
you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet, as described in chapter
8.</li>
<li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is
unencumbered.</li>
<li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws.</li>
<li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your
choice whenever you choose this benefit).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you
can change the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.</p>
<p>If you create a new transmuter's stone, the previous one ceases to
function.</p>
<h5 id="shapechanger">Shapechanger</h5>
<p>At 10th level, you add the polymorph spell to your spellbook, if it
is not there already. You can cast polymorph without expending a spell
slot. When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a
beast whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.</p>
<p>Once you cast polymorph in this way, you can't do so again until you
finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using
an available spell slot.</p>
<h5 id="master-transmuter">Master Transmuter</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can use your action to consume the
reserve of transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in
a single burst. When you do so, choose one of the following effects.
Your transmuter's stone is destroyed and can't be remade until you
finish a long rest. Major Transformation.</p>
<p>You can transmute one nonmagical object - no larger than a 5-foot
cube - into another nonmagical object of similar size and mass and of
equal or lesser value. You must spend 10 minutes handling the object to
transform it. Panacea.</p>
<p>You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature
that you touch with the transmuter's stone. The creature also regains
all its hit points. Restore Life.</p>
<p>You cast the raise dead spell on a creature you touch with the
transmuter's stone, without expending a spell slot or needing to have
the spell in your spellbook. Restore Youth.</p>
<p>You touch the transmuter's stone to a willing creature, and that
creature's apparent age is reduced by 3d10 years, to a minimum of 13
years. This effect doesn't extend the creature's lifespan.</p>
