<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="fighters">Fighters</h1>
<p>A human in clanging plate armour holds her shield before her as she
runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded
leather armour, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his
exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two
combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p>
<p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club
and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a
half-elf in scale armour, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as
she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defences.</p>
<p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident
and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd’s
delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword flares with
blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite
him.</p>
<p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of
characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights,
conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened
mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an
unparalleled mastery with weapons and armour, and a thorough knowledge
of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both
meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p>
<h2 id="well-rounded-specialists">Well-Rounded Specialists</h2>
<p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can
swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword,
use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill.
Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armour.
Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specialises in a
certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting
with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills
with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive
specialisation makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in
dungeons alike.</p>
<h2 id="trained-for-danger">Trained for Danger</h2>
<p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the
queen’s army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained
soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers,
military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar
figures are fighters.</p>
<p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The
dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among
adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from
the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but
also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the
opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-fighter">Creating a Fighter</h2>
<p>As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your
character’s background: Where did you get your combat training, and what
set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you
particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps
because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training
in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or
a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p>
<p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a
local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy,
tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished
but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits
of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where
did you acquire your weapons and armour? They might have been military
issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years
to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important
possessions—the only things that stand between you and death’s
embrace.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First,
make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on
whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse
weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or
Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype.
Second, choose the soldier background.</p>

<h3 id="martial-archetypes">Martial Archetypes</h3>
<p>Different fighters choose different approaches to perfecting their
fighting prowess. The martial archetype you choose to emulate reflects
your approach.</p>
<h4 id="champion">Champion</h4>
<p>The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical
power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this
archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal
devastating blows.</p>
<h5 id="improved-critical">Improved Critical</h5>
<p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon
attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>
<h5 id="remarkable-athlete">Remarkable Athlete</h5>
<p>Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round
up) to any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that
doesn’t already use your proficiency bonus.</p>
<p>In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can
cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.</p>
<h5 id="additional-fighting-style">Additional Fighting Style</h5>
<p>At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style
class feature.</p>
<h5 id="superior-critical">Superior Critical</h5>
<p>Starting at 15th level, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a
roll of 18–20.</p>
<h5 id="survivor">Survivor</h5>
<p>At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At
the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your
Constitution modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points
left. You don’t gain this benefit if you have 0 hit points.</p>
<h4 id="battle-master">Battle Master</h4>
<p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial
techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat
is an academic ﬁeld, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as
weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every ﬁghter absorbs the lessons of
history, theory, and artistry that are reﬂected in the Battle Master
archetype, but those who do are well-rounded ﬁghters of great skill and
knowledge.</p>
<h5 id="combat-superiority">Combat Superiority</h5>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn manoeuvres
that are fuelled by special dice called superiority dice.</p>
<h6 id="manoeuvres">Manoeuvres</h6>
<p>You learn three manoeuvres of your choice, which are detailed under
“manoeuvres" below. Many manoeuvres enhance an attack in some way. You
can use only one manoeuvre per attack.</p>
<p>You learn two additional manoeuvres of your choice at 7th, 10th, and
15th level. Each time you learn new manoeuvres, you can also replace one
manoeuvre you know with a different one.</p>
<h6 id="superiority-dice">Superiority Dice</h6>
<p>You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is
expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority
dice when you ﬁnish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th
level.</p>
<h6 id="saving-throws-1">Saving Throws</h6>
<p>Some of your manoeuvres require your target to make a saving throw to
resist the manoeuvre's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manoeuvre save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or
Dexterity modifier (your choice)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="student-of-war">Student of War</h5>
<p>Al 3rd level, you gain proﬁciency with one type of artisan‘s tools of
your choice.</p>
<h5 id="know-your-enemy">Know your Enemy</h5>
<p>Starting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or
interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain
information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells
you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to
two of the following characteristics of your choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strength score</li>
<li>Dexterity score</li>
<li>Constitution score</li>
<li>Armour Class</li>
<li>Current hit points</li>
<li>Total class levels (if any)</li>
<li>Fighter class levels (if any)</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="improved-combat-superiority">Improved Combat Superiority</h5>
<p>At 10th level. your superiority dice turn into d10s. At 18th level,
they turn into d12s.</p>
<h5 id="relentless">Relentless</h5>
<p>Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no
superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die.</p>
<h5 id="manoeuvres-1">Manoeuvres</h5>
<p>The manoeuvres are presented in alphabetical order.</p>
<h6 id="commanders-strike">Commander’s Strike</h6>
<p>When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of
your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to
strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear
you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use
its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to
the attack's damage roll.</p>
<h6 id="disarming-attack">Disarming Attack</h6>
<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one
item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to
the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving
throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object
lands at its feet.</p>
<h6 id="distracting-strike">Distracting Strike</h6>
<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening.
You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack
roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if
the attack ts made before the start of your next turn.</p>
<h6 id="evasive-footwork">Evasive Footwork</h6>
<p>When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die
and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.</p>
<h6 id="feinting-attack">Feinting Attack</h6>
<p>You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your
turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your
target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that
creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack‘s
damage roll.</p>
<h6 id="goading-attack">Goading Attack</h6>
<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You
add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has
disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until
the end of your next turn.</p>
<h6 id="lunging-attack">Lunging Attack</h6>
<p>When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expand one
superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you
hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</p>
<h6 id="manoeuvring-attack">Manoeuvring Attack</h6>
<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to manoeuvre one of your comrades into a more
advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's
damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you.
That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without
provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</p>
<h6 id="menacing-attack">Menacing Attack</h6>
<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the
superiority die to the attacks damage roll, and the target must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the
end of your next turn.</p>
<h6 id="parry">Parry</h6>
<p>When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use
your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the
number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modiﬁer.</p>
<h6 id="precision-attack">Precision Attack</h6>
<p>When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend
one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this manoeuvre
before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the
attack are applied.</p>
<h6 id="pushing-attack">Pushing Attack</h6>
<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the
superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large
or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you
push the target up to 15 feet away from you.</p>
<h6 id="rally">Rally</h6>
<p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority
die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so,
choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains
temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma
modiﬁer.</p>
<h6 id="riposte">Riposte</h6>
<p>When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your
reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack
against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the
attack's damage roll.</p>
<h6 id="sweeping-attack">Sweeping Attack</h6>
<p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend
one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same
attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and
within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second
creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your
superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original
attack.</p>
<h6 id="trip-attack">Trip Attack</h6>
<p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one
superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the
superiority die to the attack’s damage roll, and if the target is Large
or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you
knock the target prone.</p>
<h4 id="eldritch-knight">Eldritch Knight</h4>
<p>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to
all ﬁghters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical
techniques similar to those practised by wizards. They focus their study
on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation.
Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in
battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending
the ﬁghter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small
number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a
spellbook.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h5>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the
ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of
spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
<h6 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h6>
<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You
learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
<h6 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h6>
<p>The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You
regain all expended spell slots when you ﬁnish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <em>shield</em> and have
a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast shield
using either slot.</p>
<h6 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st-Level
and Higher</h6>
<p>You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard
spell list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table
shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of
these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice,
and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance,
when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of
1st or 2nd level.</p>
<p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any
school of magic.</p>
<p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the
wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard
spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're
replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th, or 20th level.</p>
<h6 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h6>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,
since you learn your spells through study and memorisation. You use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition. you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier</li>
<li>Spell attack modiﬁer = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="weapon-bond">Weapon Bond</h5>
<p>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between
yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1
hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within
your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch
the weapon and forge the bond.</p>
<p>Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can‘t be disarmed of
that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of
existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn,
causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>
<p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a
time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon,
you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p>
<h5 id="war-magic">War Magic</h5>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a cantrip,
you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>
<h5 id="eldritch-strike">Eldritch Strike</h5>
<p>At 10th level, you learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a
creature’s resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw
it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.</p>
<h5 id="arcane-charge">Arcane Charge</h5>
<p>At 15th level, you gain the ability to teleport up to 30 feet to an
unoccupied space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can
teleport before or after the additional action.</p>
<h5 id="improved-war-magic">Improved War Magic</h5>
