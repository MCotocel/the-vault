<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="barbarians">Barbarians</h1>
<p>A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and
hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who
dared poach his people’s elk herd.</p>
<p>A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over
their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she
did to the last six rivals.</p>
<p>Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his
drow foe, then turns to drive his armoured elbow into the gut of
another.</p>
<p>These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their
rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere
emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the
unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.</p>
<p>For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal
spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full
of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a
battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of
strength.</p>
<h2 id="primal-instinct">Primal Instinct</h2>
<p>People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilised ways set
them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of
superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilisation is no virtue, but a
sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature - keen
instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are
uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the
wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their
tribes live and hunt.</p>
<p>Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a
berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and
resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few
times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to
defeat whatever threats arise.</p>
<h2 id="a-life-of-danger">A Life of Danger</h2>
<p>Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of
civilised society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these
people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she
plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times
of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril:
rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge
headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to.</p>
<p>Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited
for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native
tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a
barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the
tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the
members of their adventuring parties.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-barbarian">Creating a Barbarian</h2>
<p>When creating a barbarian character, think about where your character
comes from and his or her place in the world. Talk with your DM about an
appropriate origin for your barbarian. Did you come from a distant land,
making you a stranger in the area of the campaign? Or is the campaign
set in a rough-and-tumble frontier where barbarians are common?</p>
<p>What led you to take up the adventuring life? Were you lured to
settled lands by the promise of riches? Did you join forces with
soldiers of those lands to face a shared threat? Did monsters or an
invading horde drive you out of your homeland, making you a rootless
refugee? Perhaps you were a prisoner of war, brought in chains to
“civilised” lands and only now able to win your freedom. Or you might
have been cast out from your people because of a crime you committed, a
taboo you violated, or a coup that removed you from a position of
authority.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick build</h3>
<p>You can make a barbarian quickly by following these suggestions.
First, put your highest ability score in Strength, followed by
Constitution. Second, choose the outlander background.</p>

<li>(a) Two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon</li>
<li>An explorer’s pack and four javelins</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rage">Rage</h3>
<p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can
enter a rage as a bonus action.</p>
<p>While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing
heavy armor:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving
throws.</li>
<li>When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus
to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as
shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.</li>
<li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on
them while raging.</p>
<p>Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked
unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile
creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also
end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>
<p>Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian
level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long
rest before you can rage again.</p>
<h3 id="unarmoured-defence">Unarmoured Defence</h3>
<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armour Class equals 10 +
your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a
shield and still gain this benefit.</p>
<h3 id="reckless-attack">Reckless Attack</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defence to
attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your
turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage
on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack
rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</p>
<h3 id="danger-sense">Danger Sense</h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t
as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from
danger.</p>
<p>You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that
you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t
be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.</p>
<h3 id="primal-path">Primal Path</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage.
Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both
detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you
features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="extra-attack">Extra Attack</h3>
<p>Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>
<h3 id="fast-movement">Fast Movement</h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you
aren’t wearing heavy armor.</p>
<h3 id="feral-instinct">Feral Instinct</h3>
<p>By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on
initiative rolls.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and
aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only
if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</p>
<h3 id="brutal-critical">Brutal Critical</h3>
<p>Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die
when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee
attack.</p>
<p>This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three
additional dice at 17th level.</p>
<h3 id="relentless-rage">Relentless Rage</h3>
<p>Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite
grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and
don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If
you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</p>
<p>Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by
5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>
<h3 id="brutal-critical-1">Brutal Critical</h3>
<p>At 13th level, you can roll two additional weapon damage dice when
determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</p>
<p>This increases to three additional dice at 17th level.</p>
<h3 id="persistent-rage">Persistent Rage</h3>
<p>Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early
only if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.</p>
<h3 id="brutal-critical-2">Brutal Critical</h3>
<p>At 17th level, you can roll three additional weapon damage dice when
determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
Indomitable Might</p>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less
than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the
total.</p>
<h3 id="primal-champion">Primal Champion</h3>
<p>At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and
Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now
24.</p>
<h3 id="primal-paths">Primal Paths</h3>
<p>Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or
her toward greatness. Different barbarians attribute their rage to
different sources, however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where
pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as steel. Others see
it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem animal.</p>
<h4 id="path-of-the-berserker">Path of the Berserker</h4>
<p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being
violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammelled fury,
slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the
chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p>
<h5 id="frenzy">Frenzy</h5>
<p>Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a
frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you
can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your
turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of
exhaustion.</p>
<h5 id="mindless-rage">Mindless Rage</h5>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while
raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the
effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.</p>
<h5 id="intimidating-presence">Intimidating Presence</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone
with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that
you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you,
it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you
until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your
action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature
until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends
its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.</p>
<p>If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this
feature on that creature again for 24 hours.</p>
<h5 id="retaliation">Retaliation</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is
within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon
attack against that creature.</p>
<h4 id="path-of-the-totem-warrior">Path of the Totem Warrior</h4>
<p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the
barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration.
In battle, your totem spirit ﬁlls you with supernatural might. adding
magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</p>
<p>Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a
particular clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have
more than one totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p>
<h5 id="spirit-seeker">Spirit Seeker</h5>
<p>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving
you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you
gain the ability to cast the <em>beast sense</em> and <em>speak with
animals</em> spells, but only as rituals, as described in chapter
10.</p>
<h5 id="totem-spirit">Totem Spirit</h5>
<p>At 3rd level. when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and
gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object - an
amulet or similar adornment - that incorporates fur or feathers, claws,
teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor
physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For
example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy
and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright
yellow.</p>
<p>Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but
more appropriate to your homeland. For example. you could choose a hawk
or vulture in place of an eagle.</p>
<h6 id="bear">Bear</h6>
<p>While raging. you have resistance to all damage except psychic
damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any
punishment.</p>
<h6 id="eagle">Eagle</h6>
<p>While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures
have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can
use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the
eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with
ease.</p>
<h6 id="wolf">Wolf</h6>
<p>While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack
rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you.
The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</p>
<h5 id="aspect-of-the-beast">Aspect of the Beast</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you gain a magical beneﬁt based on the totem animal of
your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or
a different one.</p>
<h6 id="bear-1">Bear</h6>
<p>You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity (including
maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage on
Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.</p>
<h6 id="eagle-1">Eagle</h6>
<p>You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up to 1 mile away with
no difficulty, able to discern even ﬁne details as though looking at
something no more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim light
doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom (Perception) checks.</p>
<h6 id="wolf-1">Wolf</h6>
<p>You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You can track other
creatures while travelling at a fast pace, and you can move stealthily
while travelling at a normal pare (see chapter 8 for rules on travel
pace).</p>
<h5 id="spirit-walker">Spirit Walker</h5>
<p>At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature spell, but only
as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals
you chose for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to
convey the information you seek.</p>
<h5 id="totemic-attunement">Totemic Attunement</h5>
<p>At 14th level. you gain a magical beneﬁt based on a totem animal of
your choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a
different one.</p>
<h6 id="bear-2">Bear</h6>
<p>While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of you that's hostile
to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you
or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to this
effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can't be frightened.</p>
