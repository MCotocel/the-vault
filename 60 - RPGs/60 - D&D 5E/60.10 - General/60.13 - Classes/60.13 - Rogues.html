<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="rogues">Rogues</h1>
<p>Signalling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward
through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out
a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she
disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick
the door open.</p>
<p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice
prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target - a notorious
slaver - passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes
to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can
make a sound.</p>
<p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts
the key ring from the guard’s belt. In a moment, the keys are in her
hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make
their escape.</p>
<p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get
the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the
solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and
versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring
party.</p>
<h2 id="skill-and-precision">Skill and Precision</h2>
<p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of
skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a
broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus
on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them
in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps,
and opening locks.</p>
<p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritise cunning over brute
strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it
exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an
opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost
supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks
to supplement their other abilities.</p>
<h2 id="a-shady-living">A Shady Living</h2>
<p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to
the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars,
assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are
organised into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues
operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to
help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living
as locksmiths, investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous
job in a world where dire rats - and wererats - haunt the sewers.</p>
<p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are
hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards,
while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some
have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of
infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-rogue">Creating a Rogue</h2>
<p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s
relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you
on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did
you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it
greed that drives you in your adventures, or some other desire or
ideal?</p>
<p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a
great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your
career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin
you needed to escape the squalor of your life. Did wanderlust finally
call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself cut
off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of
support. Or maybe you made a new friend - another member of your
adventuring party - who showed you new possibilities for earning a
living and employing your particular talents.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First,
Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your
next-highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up
the Arcane Trickster archetype. Choose Charisma instead if you plan to
emphasise deception and social interaction. Second, choose the charlatan
background.</p>

<li>Intimidation</li>
<li>Investigation</li>
<li>Perception</li>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Persuasion</li>
<li>Sleight of Hand</li>
<li>Stealth</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="equipment">Equipment</h4>
<p>You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment
granted by your background:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) A rapier or (b) a shortsword</li>
<li>(a) A shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword</li>
<li>(a) A burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an explorer’s
pack</li>
<li>Leather armour, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expertise">Expertise</h3>
<p>At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your
skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>
<p>At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in
skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>
<h3 id="sneak-attack">Sneak Attack</h3>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a
foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to
one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack
roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>
<p>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you
don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>
<p>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this
class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>
<h3 id="thieves-cant">Thieves’ Cant</h3>
<p>During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of
dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly
normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant
understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a
message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>
<p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to
convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or
the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether
the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for
thieves on the run.</p>
<h3 id="cunning-action">Cunning Action</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to
move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns
in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or
Hide action.</p>
<h3 id="roguish-archetype">Roguish Archetype</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the
exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster,
all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice
grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th
level.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and
19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or
you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="uncanny-dodge">Uncanny Dodge</h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you
with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage
against you.</p>
<h3 id="expertise-1">Expertise</h3>
<p>At 6th level, choose two more of your skill proficiencies, or one
more of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’
tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make
that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>
<h3 id="evasion">Evasion</h3>
<p>Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of
certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an
ice storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take
no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if
you fail.</p>
<h3 id="reliable-talent">Reliable Talent</h3>
<p>By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they
approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you
add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a
10.</p>
<h3 id="blindsense">Blindsense</h3>
<p>Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the
location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.</p>
<h3 id="slippery-mind">Slippery Mind</h3>
<p>By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain
proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>
<h3 id="elusive">Elusive</h3>
<p>Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely
gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against
you while you aren’t incapacitated.</p>
<h3 id="stroke-of-luck">Stroke of Luck</h3>
<p>At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need
to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss
into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat
the d20 roll as a 20.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="roguish-archetypes">Roguish Archetypes</h3>
<p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on
perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat,
and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those
talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your
choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus - not necessarily an
indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your
preferred techniques.</p>
<h4 id="thief">Thief</h4>
<p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits,
cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so
do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure
seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving
your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you
normally couldn’t employ.</p>
<h5 id="fast-hands">Fast Hands</h5>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your
Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your
thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an
Object action.</p>
<h5 id="second-story-work">Second-Story Work</h5>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to
climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra
movement.</p>
<p>In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover
increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.</p>
<h5 id="supreme-sneak">Supreme Sneak</h5>
<p>Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth)
check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.</p>
<h5 id="use-magic-device">Use Magic Device</h5>
<p>By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic
that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended
for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use
of magic items.</p>
<h5 id="thiefs-reflexes">Thief’s Reflexes</h5>
<p>When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes
and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first
round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative
and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this
feature when you are surprised.</p>
<h4 id="assassin">Assassin</h4>
<p>You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to
this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and
even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of
their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes
with deadly efﬁciency.</p>
<h5 id="bonus-proficiencies">Bonus Proficiencies</h5>
<p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proﬁciency with
the disguise kit and the poisoner's kit.</p>
<h5 id="assassinate">Assassinate</h5>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, you are at your deadliest when you get the
drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any
creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, any
hit you score against a creature that is surprised is a critical
hit.</p>
<h5 id="infiltration-expertise">Infiltration Expertise</h5>
<p>Starting at 9th level, you can unfailingly create false identities
for yourself. You must spend seven days and 25 GP to establish the
history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You can't
establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you
might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and
ofﬁcial-looking certiﬁcation to establish yourself as a member of a
trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the
company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter, if you adopt the new
identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person
until given an obvious reason not to.</p>
<h5 id="impostor">Impostor</h5>
<p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to unerringly mimic another
person’s speech, writing, and behaviour.</p>
<p>You must spend at least three hours studying these three components
of the person's behaviour, listening to speech, examining handwriting,
and observing mannerisms.</p>
<p>Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature
suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma
(Deception) check you make to avoid detection.</p>
<h5 id="death-strike">Death Strike</h5>
<p>Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When
you attack and hit a creature that is surprised, it must make a
Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modiﬁer + your
proﬁciency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack
against the creature.</p>
<h4 id="arcane-trickster">Arcane Trickster</h4>
<p>Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility
with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues
include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers,
and a significant number of adventurers.</p>
<h5 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h5>
<p>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See
chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the
wizard spell list.</p>

<h6 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h6>
<p>You learn three cantrips: mage hand and two other cantrips of your
choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of
your choice at 10th level.</p>
<h6 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h6>
<p>The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots
you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one
of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell charm person and have a
1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast charm
person using either slot.</p>
<h6 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st-Level
and Higher</h6>
<p>You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which
you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard
spell list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table
shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of
these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice,
and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance,
when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of
1st or 2nd level.</p>
<p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any
school of magic.</p>
<p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the
wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard
spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're
replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any
school of magic.</p>
<h6 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h6>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,
since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorisation.
You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting
the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier</li>
<li>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="mage-hand-legerdemain">Mage Hand Legerdemain</h5>
<p>Starting at 3rd level, when you cast mage hand, you can make the
spectral hand invisible, and you can perform the following additional
tasks with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can stow one object the hand is holding in a container worn or
carried by another creature.</li>
<li>You can retrieve an object in a container worn or carried by another
creature.</li>
<li>You can use thieves' tools to pick locks and disarm traps at
range.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can perform one of these tasks without being noticed by a
creature if you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested
by the creature's Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p>In addition, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning
Action to control the hand.</p>
<h5 id="magical-ambush">Magical Ambush</h5>
<p>Starting at 9th level, if you are hidden from a creature when you
cast a spell on it, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it
makes against the spell this turn.</p>
<h5 id="versatile-trickster">Versatile Trickster</h5>
<p>At 13th level, you gain the ability to distract targets with your
mage hand. As a bonus action on your turn, you can designate a creature
within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by the spell. Doing so gives
you advantage on attack rolls against that creature until the end of the
turn.</p>
<h5 id="spell-thief">Spell Thief</h5>
<p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge
of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.</p>
<p>Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or
includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force
the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability
modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate
the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell
if it is at least 1st level and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need
to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you know the spell and can
cast it using your spell slots. The creature can't cast that spell until
the 8 hours have passed.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.</p>
