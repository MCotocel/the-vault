<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="clerics">Clerics</h1>
<p>Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an
elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his
battle-worn companions.</p>
<p>Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to
cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to
the gods with every foe’s fall.</p>
<p>Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her
holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in
on her companions.</p>
<p>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant
planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to
embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is
imbued with divine magic.</p>
<h2 id="healers-and-warriors">Healers and Warriors</h2>
<p>Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing
from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power,
manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to
everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfil a high
calling.</p>
<p>Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric
might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability to cast
cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a deity’s
wishes.</p>
<p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their
allies with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and
dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from
heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit
most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to
let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.</p>
<h2 id="divine-agents">Divine Agents</h2>
<p>Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric.
Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out
their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength
of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office,
viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and
involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most
hierarchies.</p>
<p>When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his
or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves
braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or
seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to
protect their deities’ worshippers, which can mean fighting rampaging
orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal
that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.</p>
<p>Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established
temples and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s
aid, or a high priest might be in a position to demand it.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-cleric">Creating a Cleric</h2>
<p>As you create a cleric, the most important question to consider is
which deity to serve and what principles you want your character to
embody. The Gods of the Multiverse section includes lists of many of the
gods of the multiverse. Check with your DM to learn which deities are in
your campaign.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to
that god. Did you enter this service willingly? Or did the god choose
you, impelling you into service with no regard for your wishes? How do
the temple priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a
troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity have a
special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to prove yourself
worthy of a great quest?</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First,
Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Strength or
Constitution. Second, choose the acolyte background.</p>

<li>(a) Scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if

<li>(a) A priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
<li>A shield and a holy symbol</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells. See Spells
Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for
the cleric spell list.</p>
<h4 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric
spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at
higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric
table.</p>
<h4 id="preparing-and-casting-spells">Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
<p>The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to
cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a
number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric
level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots.</p>
<p>For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level
and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of
prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can
cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t
remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in
prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell
on your list.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power
of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your
Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
modifier</li>
<li>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
modifier</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ritual-casting">Ritual Casting</h4>
<p>You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use a holy symbol (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>
<h3 id="divine-domain">Divine Domain</h3>
<p>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light,
Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of
the class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated
with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when
you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use
Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional
beneﬁts at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>
<h4 id="domain-spells">Domain Spells</h4>
<p>Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain
at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a
domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against
the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
<p>If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell
list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>
<h3 id="channel-divinity">Channel Divinity</h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly
from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start
with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your
domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in
levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>
<p>When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to
create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel
Divinity again.</p>
<p>Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use
such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save
DC.</p>
<p>Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice
between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times
between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your
expended uses.</p>
<h4 id="channel-divinity-turn-undead">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h4>
<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30
feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its
saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any
damage.</p>
<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30
feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it
from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="destroy-undead">Destroy Undead</h3>
<p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against
your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its
challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the
Destroy Undead table.</p>

<h3 id="divine-intervention">Divine Intervention</h3>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on
your behalf when your need is great.</p>
<p>Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe
the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number
equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM
chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell
or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.</p>
<p>If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7
days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no
roll required.</p>
<h3 id="divine-domains">Divine Domains</h3>
<p>In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of
mortal life and civilisation, called a deity’s domain. All the domains
over which a deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For
example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of
Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your
deity’s portfolio to emphasise, and you are granted powers related to
that domain.</p>
<p>Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your
deity. Apollo, for example, could be worshipped in one region as Phoebus
(“radiant”) Apollo, emphasising his influence over the Light domain, and
in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasising his
association with the Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain
could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity
that appeals to you most.</p>
<p>Each domain’s description gives examples of deities who have
influence over that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the
Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings,

<h4 id="knowledge-domain">Knowledge Domain</h4>
<p>The gods of knowledge - including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and
Thotli - value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that
knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or
promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities
hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise
their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the
secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore,
collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn
all they can. Some gods of knowledge promote the practical knowledge of
craft and invention, including smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar,
Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.</p>

minute you meditate, you learn about one signiﬁcant event, beginning
with the most recent. Signiﬁcant events typically involve powerful
emotions, such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders, births
and funerals, However, they might also include more mundane events that
are nevertheless important in your current situation.</p>
<h4 id="life-domain">Life Domain</h4>
<p>The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy - one of the
fundamental forces of the universe - that sustains all life. The gods of
life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded,
caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and
undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain,
particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and
Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of
healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht),
and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and

sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every
deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art

darkness.</p>

<h4 id="nature-domain">Nature Domain</h4>
<p>Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, from
inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus, Obad-Hai,
Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with
particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as
a whole and might serve one of these deities, practising mysterious
rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue.
But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more
active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These
clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands,
bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who
anger their gods.</p>

eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods
of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The
clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to ﬁght the good
ﬁght or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include
champions of honour and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and
Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as
Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and
domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such
as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in
all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p>
