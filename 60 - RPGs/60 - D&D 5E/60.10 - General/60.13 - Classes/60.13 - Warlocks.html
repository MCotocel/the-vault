<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="warlocks">Warlocks</h1>
<p>With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden
robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and
bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p>
<p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the
secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish
magic.</p>
<p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of
the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that
will open a doorway to a distant world.</p>
<p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric
of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of
supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and
spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey
nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm,
warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.</p>
<h2 id="sworn-and-beholden">Sworn and Beholden</h2>
<p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes
the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and
a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not
gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an
archdevil, or an utterly alien entity - beings not typically served by
clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between
a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at
the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.</p>
<p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting
alterations to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in
darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike
bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at
hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armour and know how
to use simple weapons.</p>
<h2 id="delvers-into-secrets">Delvers into Secrets</h2>
<p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power,
which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst
drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as
well.</p>
<p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known.
But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a
traveller in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its
fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of
it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a
brilliant but crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the
material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p>
<p>Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can’t
be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a
mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained.
Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit
of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring.
Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward
adventure.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-warlock">Creating a Warlock</h2>
<p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about
your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What
led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron?
Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual
that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you
search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you
chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in
anticipation of the rewards promised to you?</p>
<p>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in
your character’s adventuring career. Your patron’s demands might drive
you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favours you
can do between adventures.</p>
<p>What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it
friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your
patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron’s plans?
Do you know other servants of your patron?</p>
<p>How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it
might occasionally speak with your patron’s voice. Some warlocks find
messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves,
or adrift in the clouds — messages that only the warlock can see. Other
warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or
deal only with intermediaries.</p>
<h3 id="quick-build">Quick Build</h3>
<p>You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First,
Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution.
Second, choose the charlatan background. Third, choose the eldritch
blast and chill touch cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells charm
person and witch bolt.</p>

<li>Leather armour, any simple weapon, and two daggers</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="otherworldly-patron">Otherworldly Patron</h3>
<p>At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of
your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which
is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you
features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>
<h3 id="pact-magic">Pact Magic</h3>
<p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron
have given you facility with spells. See Spells Rules for the general
rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the warlock spell
list.</p>
<h4 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h4>
<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You
learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p>
<h4 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h4>
<p>The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the
level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To
cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend
a spell slot. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when you
finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell
slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of
those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
<h4 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st Level
and Higher</h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the
warlock spell list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn
more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you
choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s
Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example,
you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from
the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you
use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll
with one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier</li>
<li>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h4>
<p>You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a
spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p>
<h3 id="eldritch-invocations">Eldritch Invocations</h3>
<p>In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch
invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an
abiding magical ability.</p>
<p>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your
invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description.
When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of
your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock
table.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one
of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that
you could learn at that level.</p>
<p>If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to
learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet
its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this
class.</p>
<h4 id="agonising-blast">Agonising Blast</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip</p>
<p>When you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the
damage it deals on a hit.</p>
<h4 id="armour-of-shadows">Armour of Shadows</h4>
<p>You can cast mage armour on yourself at will, without expending a
spell slot or material components.</p>
<h4 id="ascendant-step">Ascendant Step</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 9th level</p>
<p>You can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell
slot or material components.</p>
<h4 id="beast-speech">Beast Speech</h4>
<p>You can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell
slot.</p>
<h4 id="beguiling-influence">Beguiling Influence</h4>
<p>You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.</p>
<h4 id="bewitching-whispers">Bewitching Whispers</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 7th level</p>
<p>You can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do
so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="book-of-ancient-secrets">Book of Ancient Secrets</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature</p>
<p>You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose
two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell
list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the
book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your
Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You
can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by
some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual
if it has the ritual tag.</p>
<p>On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of
Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the
spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded
up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each
level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50
GP for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.</p>
<h4 id="chains-of-carceri">Chains of Carceri</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature</p>
<p>You can cast hold monster at will - targeting a celestial, fiend, or
elemental - without expending a spell slot or material components. You
must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same
creature again.</p>
<h4 id="devils-sight">Devil’s Sight</h4>
<p>You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a
distance of 120 feet.</p>
<h4 id="dreadful-word">Dreadful Word</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 7th level</p>
<p>You can cast confusion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do
so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="eldritch-sight">Eldritch Sight</h4>
<p>You can cast detect magic at will, without expending a spell
slot.</p>
<h4 id="eldritch-spear">Eldritch Spear</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip</p>
<p>When you cast eldritch blast, its range is 300 feet.</p>
<h4 id="eyes-of-the-rune-keeper">Eyes of the Rune Keeper</h4>
<p>You can read all writing.</p>
<h4 id="fiendish-vigour">Fiendish Vigour</h4>
<p>You can cast false life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell,
without expending a spell slot or material components.</p>
<h4 id="gaze-of-two-minds">Gaze of Two Minds</h4>
<p>You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive
through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the
creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your
action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the
duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the
other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed
by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own
surroundings.</p>
<h4 id="lifedrinker">Lifedrinker</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature</p>
<p>When you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes
extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).</p>
<h4 id="mask-of-many-faces">Mask of Many Faces</h4>
<p>You can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell
slot.</p>
<h4 id="master-of-myriad-forms">Master of Myriad Forms</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 15th level</p>
<p>You can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot.</p>
<h4 id="minions-of-chaos">Minions of Chaos</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 9th level</p>
<p>You can cast conjure elemental once using a warlock spell slot. You
can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="mire-the-mind">Mire the Mind</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 5th level</p>
<p>You can cast slow once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so
again until you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="misty-visions">Misty Visions</h4>
<p>You can cast silent image at will, without expending a spell slot or
material components.</p>
<h4 id="one-with-shadows">One with Shadows</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 5th level</p>
<p>When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your
action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a
reaction.</p>
<h4 id="otherworldly-leap">Otherworldly Leap</h4>
<p>Prerequisite: 9th level</p>
<p>You can cast jump on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot

<h3 id="pact-boon">Pact Boon</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for
your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your
choice.</p>
<h4 id="pact-of-the-blade">Pact of the Blade</h4>
<p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand.
You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you
create it (see the Weapons section for weapon options). You are
proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for
the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks
and damage.</p>
<p>Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you
for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again,
if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p>
<p>You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by
performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the
ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.
You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional
space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter.
You can’t affect an artefact or a sentient weapon in this way. The
weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the
1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to
break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the
extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p>
<h4 id="pact-of-the-chain">Pact of the Chain</h4>
<p>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The
spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for
your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon,
quasit, or sprite.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of
your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its
reaction.</p>
<h4 id="pact-of-the-tome">Pact of the Tome</h4>
<p>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you
gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list
(the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your
person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against
your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell
list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.</p>
<p>If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony
to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be
performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous
book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Your Pact Noon Each Pact Boon option produces a special
creature or an object that reﬂects your patron's nature.</p>
<h4 id="pact-of-the-chain-1">Pact of the Chain</h4>
<p>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical Familiar. Its default
form can be a reﬂection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons
tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the
Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar Form is suitable for
it.</p>
<h4 id="pact-of-the-blade-1">Pact of the Blade</h4>
<p>If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade
wrapped in leafy vines. lf you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an
axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your
patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking
spear with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a
terrible unblinking eye.</p>
<h4 id="pact-of-the-tome-1">Pact of the Tome</h4>
<p>Your Book of Shadows might be a ﬁne, gilt-edged tome with spells of
enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could
be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells
of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions
of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of
a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps
of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to
understand and cast</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="ability-score-improvement">Ability Score Improvement</h3>
<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>
<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to
take a feat of your choice instead.</p>
<h3 id="mystic-arcanum">Mystic Arcanum</h3>
<p>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called
an arcanum. Choose one ﬁrth-level spell from the warlock spell list as
this arcanum.</p>
<p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot.
You must ﬁnish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
<p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that
can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one
8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level.
You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you ﬁnish a long
rest.</p>
<h3 id="eldritch-master">Eldritch Master</h3>
<p>At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power
while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can
spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your
expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell
slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do
so again.</p>
<h3 id="otherworldly-patrons">Otherworldly Patrons</h3>
<p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants
of other planes of existence - not gods, but almost godlike in their
power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers
and invocations, and expect significant favours in return.</p>
<p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively
freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other
patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with
only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each
other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p>
<h4 id="the-archfey">The Archfey</h4>
<p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who
holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born.
This being's motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical,
and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settling
of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the
Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the
Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the Prince of
Fools; and ancient hags.</p>
<h5 id="expanded-spell-list">Expanded Spell List</h5>
<p>The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you
learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock
spell list for you.</p>

<h5 id="fey-presence">Fey Presence</h5>
<p>Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to
project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action,
you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to
make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The
creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by
you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="misty-escape">Misty Escape</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response
to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn
invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you
attack or cast a spell.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="beguiling-defences">Beguiling Defences</h5>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the
mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to
being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can
use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature.
The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock
spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature
takes any damage.</p>
<h5 id="dark-delirium">Dark Delirium</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory
realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet
of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell
save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your
choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you
are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature
takes any damage.</p>
<p>Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty
realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear
only itself, you, and the illusion.</p>
<p>You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature
again.</p>
<h4 id="the-great-old-one">The Great Old One</h4>
<p>Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to
the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space
beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in
legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge
so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in
comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be
unaware of your existence or entirely indifferent to you, but the
secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it. Entities
of this type include Ghaunadar, called That Which Lurks; Tharizdun, the
Chained God; Dendar, the Night Serpent; Zargon, the Returner; Great
Cthulhu; and other unfathomable beings</p>
<h5 id="expanded-spell-list-1">Expanded Spell List</h5>
<p>The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list of spells

<h5 id="awakened-mind">Awakened Mind</h5>
<p>Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to
touch the minds of other creatures. You can telepathically speak to any
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a
language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic
utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one
language.</p>
<h5 id="entropic-ward">Entropic Ward</h5>
<p>At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and
to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a
creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to
impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next
attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the
end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="thought-shield">Thought Shield</h5>
<p>Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or
other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic
damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that
creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.</p>
<h5 id="create-thrall">Create Thrall</h5>
<p>At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with
the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an
incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a
remove curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from
it, or you use this feature again.</p>
<p>You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long
as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.</p>
<h4 id="the-fiend">The Fiend</h4>
<p>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence,
a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such
beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately
including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon
lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils
such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and
balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the
yugoloths.</p>
<h5 id="expanded-spell-list-2">Expanded Spell List</h5>

<h5 id="dark-ones-blessing">Dark One’s Blessing</h5>
<p>Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit
points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier +
your warlock level (minimum of 1).</p>
<h5 id="dark-ones-own-luck">Dark One’s Own Luck</h5>
<p>Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in
your favour. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can
use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing
the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.</p>
<h5 id="fiendish-resilience">Fiendish Resilience</h5>
<p>Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you
finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type
until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical
weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.</p>
<h5 id="hurl-through-hell">Hurl Through Hell</h5>
<p>Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you
can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower
planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare
landscape.</p>
<p>At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it
previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is
not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific
experience.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
long rest.</p>
