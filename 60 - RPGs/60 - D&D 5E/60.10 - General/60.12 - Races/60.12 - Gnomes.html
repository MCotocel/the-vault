<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="gnomes">Gnomes</h1>
<p>A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and
neighbourhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder
sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor
explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of
laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of
invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.</p>
<h2 id="vibrant-expression">Vibrant expression</h2>
<p>A gnome‘s energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch
of his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and
weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with
broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes
shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in
every direction, as if expressing the gnome‘s insatiable interest in
everything around.</p>
<p>A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male
gnome's heard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed
but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing,
though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with
embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.</p>
<h2 id="delighted-dedication">Delighted dedication</h2>
<p>As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and
they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to ﬁve
centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the
course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savour the
beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that
even with all that time, they can't get in enough of the things they
want to do and see.</p>
<p>Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts out of their heads
fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of
subjects, they still manage to listen carefully to others, adding the
appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.</p>
<p>Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks,
they're just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many
gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkers, and inventors.
They're willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process
of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and
dreaming large.</p>
<h2 id="bright-burrows">Bright burrows</h2>
<p>Gnomes make their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground
but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living
world on the surface whenever they can. Their homes are well hidden by
both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are
quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome
are unlikely to ﬁnd the burrows in the ﬁrst place.</p>
<p>Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers,
sages, or tinkers. Some human families retain gnome tutors, ensuring
that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted
enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human
family over the course of his or her long life.</p>
<h2 id="seeing-the-world">Seeing the world</h2>
<p>Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to
see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other
ﬁne items, some gnomes take to adventuring as a quick, if dangerous,
path to wealth. Regardless of what spurs them to adventure, gnomes who
adopt this way of life eke as much enjoyment out of it as they do out of
any other activity they undertake, sometimes to the great annoyance of
their adventuring companions.</p>

<h2 id="gnome-names">Gnome Names</h2>
<p>Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome’s
mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a
name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might
not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of
ancestors or distant relatives, though some are purely new inventions.
When dealing with humans and others who are “stuffy” about names, a
gnome learns to use no more than three names: a personal name, a clan
name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that’s the most
fun to say.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Male Names: Alston, Alvyn, Boddynock, Brocc, Burgell, Dimble,
Eldon, Erky, - Fonkin, Frug, Gerbo, Gimble, Glim, Jebeddo, Kellen,

<h2 id="gnome-traits">Gnome traits</h2>
<p>Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all
other gnomes.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-increase">Ability score increase</h3>
<p>Your Intelligence score increases by 2.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do. and most are expected to
settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to
almost 500 years.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are, sages,
engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who
tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful
jewellers. Gnomes are good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them
are more playful than vicious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Always Appreciative It's rare for a gnome to be hostile or
malicious unless he or she has suffered a grievous injury. Gnomes know
that most races don't share their sense of humour, but they enjoy
anyone's company just as they enjoy everything else they set out to
do.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds.
Your size is Small.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
<h3 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
<p>Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and
dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it
were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't
discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
<h3 id="gnome-cunning">Gnome Cunning</h3>
<p>You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving
throws against magic.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish
language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical
treatises and its catalogues of knowledge about the natural world.</p>
<h3 id="subrace">Subrace</h3>
<p>Two subraces of gnomes are found among the worlds of D&amp;D: forest
gnomes and rock gnomes. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
<h3 id="forest-gnome">Forest gnome</h3>
<p>As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion and inherent
quickness‘and stealth. In the worlds of D&amp;D, forest gnomes are rare
and secretive. They gather in hidden communities in Sylvan forests,
using illusions and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or to
mask their escape should they be detected. Forest gnomes tend to be
friendly with other good-spirited woodland folk, and they regard elves
and good fey as their most important allies. These gnomes also befriend
small forest animals and rely on them for information about threats that
might prowl their lands.</p>
<h5 id="ability-score-increase-1">Ability Score Increase</h5>
<p>Your Dexterity score increases by 1.</p>
<h5 id="natural-illusionist">Natural Illusionist</h5>
<p>You know the minor illusion cantrip. Intelligence is your
spellcasting ability for it.</p>
<h5 id="speak-with-small-beasts">Speak with Small Beasts</h5>
<p>Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas with
Small or smaller beasts. Forest gnomes love animals and often keep
squirrels, badgers, rabbits, moles, woodpeckers, and other creatures as
beloved pets.</p>
<h3 id="rock-gnome">Rock gnome</h3>
<p>As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness
beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes in the worlds of D&amp;D are
rock gnomes, including the tinker gnomes of the Dragonlance setting.</p>
<h4 id="ability-score-increase-2">Ability Score Increase</h4>
<p>Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
<h4 id="artificers-lore">Artificer's Lore</h4>
<p>Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to magic
items, alchemical objects, or technological devices, you can add twice
your proﬁciency bonus, instead of any proﬁciency bonus you normally
apply.</p>
<h4 id="tinker">Tinker</h4>
<p>You have proﬁciency with artisan’s tools (tinker's tools). Using
those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 GP worth of materials to
construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP). The device ceases to
function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep
the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at
that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have
up to three such devices active at a time.</p>
<p>When you create a device. choose one of the following options:</p>
<h5 id="clockwork-toy">Clockwork Toy</h5>
<p>This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog,
mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy
moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random
direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it
represents.</p>
<h5 id="fire-starter">Fire Starter</h5>
<p>The device produces a miniature ﬂame, which you can use to light a
candle, torch, or campﬁre. Using the device requires your action.</p>
<h5 id="music-box">Music Box</h5>
<p>When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume.
The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is
closed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Deep gnomes A third subrace of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or
svirfneblin), live in small communities scattered in the Underdark.
Unlike the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as their
surface cousins. However, their humour and enthusiasm are dampened by
their oppressive environment, and their inventive expertise is directed
mostly toward stonework.</p>
