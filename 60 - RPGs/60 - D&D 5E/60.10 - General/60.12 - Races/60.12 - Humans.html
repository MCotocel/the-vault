<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="humans">Humans</h1>
<p>In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the
common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in
comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of
their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in
the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to
prove to the elder races, and that’s why they build their mighty empires
on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans
are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.</p>
<h2 id="a-broad-spectrum">A broad spectrum</h2>
<p>With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more
physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human.
An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and
weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black
to very pale, and hair colours from black to blond (curly, kinky, or
straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot
of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or
other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely
live even a single century.</p>
<h2 id="variety-in-all-things">Variety in all things</h2>
<p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common
races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many
different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they
stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that
can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a
relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves
traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's
memory. They live fully in the present - making them well suited to the
adventuring life - but also plan for the future, striving to leave a
lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable
opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social
dynamics.</p>
<h2 id="lasting-institutions">Lasting institutions</h2>
<p>Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of
guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred
orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halﬂing
elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human
temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law ﬁx their traditions in
the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for
those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death's
clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when
they are gone.</p>
<p>Although some humans can be xenophobic, in general their societies
are inclusive. Human lands welcome large numbers of nonhumans compared
to the proportion of humans who live in nonhuman lands.</p>
<h2 id="exemplars-of-ambition">Exemplars of ambition</h2>
<p>Humans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members
of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of
their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other
people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Everyone's second-best friends Just as readily as they mix
with each other, humans mingle with members of other races. They get
along with almost everyone, though they might not be close to many.
Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and
functionaries of all kinds. --- Dwarves: "They're stout folk, stalwart
friends, and true to their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall,
though."</p>
<p>Elves: “It‘s best not to wander into elven woods. They don't like
intruders, and you'll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows.
Still, if an elf can get past that damned racial pride and actually
treat you like an equal, you can learn a lot from them."</p>
<p>Halflings: "It’s hard to beat a meal in a halﬂing home, as long as
you don't crack your head on the ceiling - good food and good stories in
front of a nice, warm ﬁre. If halﬂings had a shred of ambition, they
might really amount to something.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="human-names-and-ethnicities">Human Names and Ethnicities</h2>
<p>Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole
have no typical names. Some human parents give their children names from
other languages, such as Dwarvish or Elvish (pronounced more or less
correctly), but most parents give names that are linked to their
region’s culture or to the naming traditions of their ancestors.</p>
<p>The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can
change wildly from region to region. In the Forgotten Realms, for
example, the clothing, architecture, cuisine, music, and literature are
different in the northwestern lands of the Silver Marches than in
distant Turmish or Impiltur to the east—and even more distinctive in
far-off Kara-Tur. Human physical characteristics, though, vary according
to the ancient migrations of the earliest humans, so that the humans of
the Silver Marches have every possible variation of coloration and
features.</p>
<p>In the Forgotten Realms, nine human ethnic groups are widely
recognised, though over a dozen others are found in more localised areas
of Faerun. These groups, and the typical names of their members, can be
used as inspiration no matter which world your human is in.</p>
