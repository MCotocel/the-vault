<h1 id="dragonborn">Dragonborn</h1>
<p>Born of dragons. as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly
through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by
draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched
from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of
dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true
dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still
others ﬁnd themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p>
<h2 id="proud-dragon-kin">Proud dragon kin</h2>
<p>Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid
form, though they lack wings or a tail. The ﬁrst dragonborn had scales
of vibrant hues matching the colours of their dragon kin, but
generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance.
Their small, ﬁne scales are usually brass or bronze in colour, sometimes
ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and
strongly built, often standing close to 6% feet tall and weighing 300
pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talon-like claws with
three ﬁngers and a thumb on each hand.</p>
<p>The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through
some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more
closely match those of their dragon ancestor - bright red, green, blue,
or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass,
copper, or bronze.</p>
<h2 id="self-sufficient-clans">Self-sufficient clans</h2>
<p>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself.
Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else,
even the gods. Each dragonborn's conduct reﬂects on the honour of his or
her clan, and bringing dishonour to the clan can result in expulsion and
exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the
clan, and honour demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p>
<p>A continual drive for self-improvement reﬂects the self-sufﬁciency of
the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all
endeavours. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme
efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of
a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share
the same commitment ﬁnd it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.</p>
<p>Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufﬁcient, they recognise
that help is sometimes needed in difﬁcult situations. But the best
source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns
to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races - or even
from the gods.</p>

<h2 id="dragonborn-names">Dragonborn Names</h2>
<p>Dragonborn have personal names given at birth, but they put their
clan names first as a mark of honour. A childhood name or nickname is
often used among clutchmates as a descriptive term or a term of
endearment. The name might recall an event or centre on a habit.</p>

<p>You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the
Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are
determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Draconians In the Dragonlance setting, the followers of the
evil goddess Takhisis learned a dark ritual that let them corrupt the
eggs of metallic dragons, producing evil dragonborn called draconians.
Five types of draconians, corresponding to the ﬁve types of metallic
dragons. fought for Takhisis in the War of the Lance: auraks (gold),
baaz (brass), bozak (bronze), kapak (copper), and sivak (silver). In
place of their draconic breath weapons. they have unique magical
abilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="breath-weapon">Breath weapon</h3>
<p>You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic
ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the
exhalation.</p>
<p>When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the
exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by
your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your
Constitution modiﬁer + your proﬁciency bonus. A creature takes 2d6
damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.
The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at
16th level.</p>
<p>After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you
complete a short or long rest.</p>
<h3 id="damage-resistance">Damage resistance</h3>
<p>You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic
ancestry.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is
thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study
of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes
numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</p>
