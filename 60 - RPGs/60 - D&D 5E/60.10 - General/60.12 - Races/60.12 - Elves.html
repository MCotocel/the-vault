<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="elves">Elves</h1>
<p>Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world
but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in
the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie
light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances
waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music
and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p>
<h2 id="slender-and-graceful">Slender and graceful</h2>
<p>With their unearthly grace and ﬁne features, elves appear hauntingly
beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly
shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to
just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100
to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males
are only marginally heavier than females.</p>
<p>Elves' coloration encompasses the normal human range and also
includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair
of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves
have no facial and little body hair. They favour elegant clothing in
bright colours, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewellery.</p>
<h2 id="a-timeless-perspective">A timeless perspective</h2>
<p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective
on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They
are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than
greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance.
When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or
learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They
are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them.
They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with
vengeance.</p>
<p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are ﬂexible in the face of
danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences
before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from
intrusions into their woodland homes, conﬁdent that they can simply wait
the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial
side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>
<h2 id="hidden-woodland-realms">Hidden woodland realms</h2>
<p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees.
Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and
magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and
plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting ﬁnely worked clothes
and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though
a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals
(which they have no interest in mining). Elves encountered outside their
own lands are commonly travelling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human
nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or
magic to their children.</p>
<h2 id="exploration-and-adventure">Exploration and adventure</h2>
<p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so
long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They
dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented front day to day
but constantly changing over decades, so they ﬁnd careers that let them
travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their
martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows
them to do so. Some might join with rebels ﬁghting against oppression,
and others might become champions of moral causes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Haughty but gracious Although they can be haughty, elves are
generally gracious even to those who fall short of their high
expectations - which is most non-elves. Still, they can ﬁnd good in just
about anyone. --- Dwarves: "Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they
lack in humour, sophistication, and manners, they make up in valour. And
I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven
quality."</p>
<p>Halflings: “Halﬂings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not
a quality to scorn. They're good folk, they care for each other and tend
their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem
when the need arises."</p>
<p>Humans: "All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish
something before their brief lives pass away - human endeavours seem so
futile sometimes. But then you look at what they have accomplished, and
you have to appreciate their achievements. If only they could slow down
and learn some reﬁnement.“</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="elf-names">Elf Names</h2>
<p>Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults,
some time after the hundredth birthday, and before this period they are
called by child names.</p>
<p>On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those
who knew him or her as a youngster might continue to use the child name.
Each elf’s adult name is a unique creation, though it might reflect the
names of respected individuals or other family members. Little
distinction exists between male names and female names; the groupings
here reflect only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a
family name, typically a combination of other Elvish words. Some elves
travelling among humans translate their family names into Common, but
others retain the Elvish version.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="elven-traits">Elven traits</h2>
<p>Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities. the result of
thousands of years of elven reﬁnement.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-increase">Ability Score Increase</h3>
<p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as
humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth
to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and
an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years
old.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean
strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect
others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than
not. The drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made
them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds.
Your size is Medium.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<h3 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
<p>Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior
vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60
feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
dim light. You can't discern colour in darkness, only shades of
grey.</p>
<h3 id="keen-senses">Keen Senses</h3>
<p>You have proﬁciency in the Perception skill.</p>
<h3 id="fey-ancestry">Fey Ancestry</h3>
<p>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic
can't put you to sleep.</p>
<h3 id="trance">Trance</h3>
<p>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining
semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation
is “trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such
dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reﬂexive through
years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same beneﬁt
that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is ﬂuid,
with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich
and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many
bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their
repertoires.</p>
<h3 id="subrace">Subrace</h3>
<p>Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main
subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly
called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these
subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves
of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower
subrace.</p>
<h4 id="high-elf">High elf</h4>
<p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the
basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds
of high elves. One type (which includes the grey elves and valley elves
of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the
Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be
superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including
the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon
elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and
often encountered among humans and other races.</p>
<p>The sun elves of Faerﬂn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves)
have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes
are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or
gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with
blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various
shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or
green and ﬂecked with gold.</p>
<h5 id="ability-score-increase-1">Ability Score Increase</h5>
<p>Your Intelligence score increases by 1.</p>
<h5 id="elf-weapon-training">Elf Weapon Training</h5>
<p>You have proﬁciency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and
longbow.</p>
<h5 id="cantrip">Cantrip</h5>

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.</p>
<h5 id="extra-language">Extra Language</h5>
<p>You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.</p>
<h4 id="wood-elf">Wood elf</h4>
<p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet
feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This
category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti
of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and
the Forgotten Realms. In Faerﬁn, wood elves (also called wild elves.
green elves. or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of
non-elves.</p>
<p>Wood elves' skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces
of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is
occasionally blond or copper-coloured. Their eyes are green, brown, or
hazel.</p>
<h5 id="ability-score-increase-2">Ability Score Increase</h5>
<p>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
<h5 id="elf-weapon-training-1">Elf Weapon Training</h5>
<p>You have proﬁciency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and
longbow.</p>
<h5 id="fleet-of-foot">Fleet of Foot</h5>
<p>Your base walking speed increases to 35 feet.</p>
<h5 id="mask-of-the-wild">Mask of the Wild</h5>
<p>You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by
foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural
phenomena.</p>
<h4 id="dark-elf-drow">Dark elf (drow)</h4>
<p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow
were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth
down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own
civilisation in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of
Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles
polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly
have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of
lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner
than most elves.</p>
<p>Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds.
Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow
character.</p>
<h5 id="ability-score-increase-3">Ability Score Increase</h5>
<p>Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
<h5 id="superior-darkvision">Superior Darkvision</h5>
<p>Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.</p>
<h5 id="sunlight-sensitivity">Sunlight Sensitivity</h5>
<p>You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or
whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>
<h5 id="drow-magic">Drow Magic</h5>
<p>You know the dancing lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you
can cast the faerie ﬁre spell once per day. When you reach 5th level,
you can also cast the darkness spell once per day. Charisma is your
spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
<h5 id="drow-weapon-training">Drow Weapon Training</h5>
<p>You have proﬁciency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand
crossbows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] The darkness of the drow Were it not for one renowned
exception. the race of drow would be universally reviled, To most. they
are a race of demon worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean
depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest nights to pillage
and slaughter the surface dwellers they despise. Their society is
depraved and preoccupied with the favour of Lolth, their spider-goddess,
who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire families as noble
houses vie for position.</p>
<p>Yet one drow, at least. broke the mould. In the world of the
Forgotten Realms, Drizzt Do‘Urden, ranger of the North, has proven his
quality as a goodhearted defender of the weak and innocent. Rejecting
his heritage and adrift in a world that looks upon him with terror and
loathing, Drizzt is a model for those few drow who follow in his
footsteps, trying to ﬁnd a life apart from the evil society of their
Underdark homes.</p>
<p>Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are inferior,
worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a conscience or ﬁnd it
necessary to cooperate with members of other races ﬁnd it hard to
overcome that prejudice, especially when they are so often on the
receiving end of hatred.</p>
