<h1 id="tieflings">Tieflings</h1>
<p>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult
on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of
the tieﬂing. And to twist the knife, tieﬂings know that this is because
a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus - overlord
of the Nine Hells - into their bloodline. Their appearance and their
nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which
they and their children and their children's children will always be
held accountable.</p>
<h2 id="infernal-bloodline">Infernal bloodline</h2>
<p>Tieﬂings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest
possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage
has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieﬂings have large horns
that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a
ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some
spiral upward like an antelopes' horns. They have thick tails, four to
ﬁve feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset
or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are
solid colours - black, red, white, silver, or gold - with no visible
sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human
coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair,
cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or
brown to dark red, blue, or purple.</p>
<h2 id="self-reliant-and-suspicious">Self-reliant and suspicious</h2>
<p>Tieﬂings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or
towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow
up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among
other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more
respect.</p>
<p>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own
way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are
not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a
tieﬂing‘s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tieﬂing
learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tieﬂing gives
someone loyalty, the tieﬂing is a ﬁrm friend or ally for life.</p>

<h2 id="tiefling-names">Tiefling Names</h2>
<p>Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into
another culture typically have names reflective of that culture. Some
have names derived from the Infernal language, passed down through
generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger
tieflings, striving to find a place in the world, adopt a name that
signifies a virtue or other concept and then try to embody that concept.
For some, the chosen name is a noble quest. For others, it’s a grim
destiny.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Male Infernal Names: Akmenos, Amnon, Barakas, Damakos, Ekemon,
Iados, Kairon, Leucis, Melech, Mordai, Morthos, Pelaios, Skamos,
Therai</p></li>
<li><p>Female Infernal Names: Akta, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella, Damaia,
Ea, Kallista, Lerissa, Makaria, Nemeia, Orianna, Phelaia, Rieta</p></li>
<li><p>“Virtue” Names: Art, Carrion, Chant, Creed, Despair, Excellence,
Fear, Glory, Hope, Ideal, Music, Nowhere, Open, Poetry, Quest, Random,
Reverence, Sorrow, Temerity, Torment, Weary</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tiefling-traits">Tiefling traits</h2>
<p>Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal
descent.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-increase">Ability Score Increase</h3>
<p>Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score
increases by 2.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>Tieﬂings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years
longer.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Tieﬂings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of
them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many
tieﬂings toward a chaotic alignment.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Tieﬂings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is
Medium.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<h3 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
<p>Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark
and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if
it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't
discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
<h3 id="hellish-resistance">Hellish Resistance</h3>
<p>You have resistance to ﬁre damage.</p>
<h3 id="infernal-legacy">Infernal Legacy</h3>
<p>You know the thaumaturgy cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can
cast the hellish rebuke spell once per day as a 2nd-level spell. Once
you reach 5th level, you can also cast the darkness spell once per day.
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Mutual Mistrust People tend to be suspicious of tieﬂings,
assuming that their infernal heritage has left its mark on their
personality and morality, not just their appearance. Shopkeepers keep a
close eye on their goods when tieﬂings enter their stores, the town
watch might follow a tieﬂing around for a while, and demagogues blame
tieﬂings for strange happenings. The reality, though, is that a
tieﬂing's bloodline doesn't affect his or her personality to any great
degree. Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most
tieﬂings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live
up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply
very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with this
mistrust throughout youth, a tieﬂing often develops the ability to
overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.</p>
