<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="dwarves">Dwarves</h1>
<p>Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of
mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing
forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of
goblins and ores - these common threads unite all dwarves.</p>
<h2 id="short-and-stout">Short and stout</h2>
<p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and
workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall,
dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human
standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also
easily a match for any of the larger folk.</p>
<p>Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red,
but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain
tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually
black, grey, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male
dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.</p>
<h2 id="long-memory-long-grudges">Long memory, long grudges</h2>
<p>Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living
dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the
oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten
Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs
conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250
years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that
shorter-lived races such as humans and halﬂings lack.</p>
<p>Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love,
weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little
change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their
ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the
youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of
those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the
dwarven ideals of industrious labour, skill in battle, and devotion to
the forge.</p>
<p>Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and
decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves
have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they
have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s
entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become
a full-blown clan feud.</p>
<h2 id="clans-and-kingdoms">Clans and kingdoms</h2>
<p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves
mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the
beauty and artistry of precious metals and ﬁne jewellery, and in some
dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't ﬁnd
in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so
enterprising humans and halﬂings frequently handle trade in dwarven
goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome
in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.</p>
<p>The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly
value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms
cherish their clan identities and afﬁliations, recognise related
dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be
clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.</p>
<p>Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially
weaponsmiths, armourers, and jewellers. Some become mercenaries or
bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>
<h2 id="gods-gold-and-clan">Gods, gold, and clan</h2>
<p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a
desire for treasure - for its own sake, for a speciﬁc purpose, or even
out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by
the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a
desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are
also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan’s lost
honour, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place
within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for
the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the ﬁeld of battle
centuries ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Slow to trust Dwarves get along passably well with most other
races. “The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a
hundred years." is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly
points to how difﬁcult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like
humans to earn a dwarf‘s trust. --- Elves: “It’s not wise to depend on
the elves. No telling what an elf will do next; when the hammer meets
the orc’s head, they‘re as apt to start singing as to pull out a sword.
They're ﬂighty and frivolous. Two things to be said for them, though:
They don‘t have many smiths, but the ones they have do very ﬁne work.
And when orcs or goblins come streaming down out of the mountains, an
elf's good to have at your back. Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no
doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do."</p>
<p>Halflings: "Sure, they're pleasant folk. But show me a halﬂing hero.
An empire, a triumphant army. Even a treasure for the ages made by
halﬂing hands. Nothing. How can you take them seriously?"</p>
<p>Humans: "You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the
human's on her deathbed, If you're lucky, she‘s got kin—a daughter or
granddaughter, maybe—who's got hands and heart as good as hers. That's
when you can make a human friend. And watch them go! They set their
hearts on something, they’ll get it, whether it's a dragon‘s hoard or an
empire‘s throne. You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it
gets them in trouble more often than not."</p>

<h2 id="dwarf-names">Dwarf Names</h2>
<p>A dwarf’s name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance with
tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been used and reused down
through the generations. A dwarf’s name belongs to the clan, not to the
individual. A dwarf who misuses or brings shame to a clan name is
stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any dwarven name in its
place.</p>

<h2 id="dwarf-traits">Dwarf traits</h2>
<p>Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and
parcel of dwarven nature.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-increase">Ability Score Increase</h3>
<p>Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re considered
young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350
years.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Most dwarves are lawful, believing ﬁrmly in the beneﬁts of a
well-ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense
of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the beneﬁts
of a just order.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds.
Your size is Medium.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by
wearing heavy armor.</p>
<h3 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
<p>Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and
dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it
were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t
discern colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
<h3 id="dwarven-resilience">Dwarven Resilience</h3>
<p>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have
resistance against poison damage.</p>
<h3 id="dwarven-combat-training">Dwarven Combat Training</h3>
<p>You have proﬁciency with the battleaxe, handaxe, throwing hammer, and
warhammer.</p>
<h3 id="tool-proﬁciency">Tool Proﬁciency</h3>
<p>You gain proﬁciency with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's
tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.</p>
<h3 id="stonecunning">Stonecunning</h3>
<p>Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the
origin of stonework, you are considered proﬁcient in the History skill
and add double your proﬁciency bonus to-the check, instead of your
normal proﬁciency bonus.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full
of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill
over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.</p>
<h3 id="subrace">Subrace</h3>
<p>Two main subraces of dwarves populate the worlds of D&amp;D: hill
dwarves and mountain dwarves. Choose one of these subraces.</p>
<h4 id="hill-dwarf">Hill dwarf</h4>
<p>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable
resilience. The gold dwarves of Faerun in their mighty southern kingdom
are hill dwarves, as are the exiled Neidar and the debased Klar of Krynn
in the Dragonlance setting.</p>
<h5 id="ability-score-increase-1">Ability Score Increase</h5>
<p>Your Wisdom score increases by 1.</p>
<h5 id="dwarven-toughness">Dwarven Toughness</h5>
<p>Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every
time you gain a level.</p>
<h4 id="mountain-dwarf">Mountain dwarf</h4>
<p>As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, accustomed to a
difﬁcult life in rugged terrain. You're probably on the tall side (for a
dwarf), and tend toward lighter coloration. The shield dwarves of
norhern Faerun, as well as the ruling Hylar clan and the noble Daewar
clan of Dragonlance, are mountain dwarves.</p>
<h5 id="ability-score-increase-2">Ability Score Increase</h5>
<p>Your Strength score increases by 2.</p>
<h5 id="dwarven-armour-training">Dwarven Armour Training</h5>
<p>You have proﬁciency with light and medium armor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Duergar In cities deep in the Underdark live the duergar, or
grey dwarves. These vicious. stealthy slave traders raid the surface
world for captives, then sell their prey to the other races of the
Underdark. They have innate magical abilities to become invisible and to
temporarily grow to giant size.</p>
