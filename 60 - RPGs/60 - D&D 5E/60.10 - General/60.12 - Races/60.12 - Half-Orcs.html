<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="half-orcs">Half-Orcs</h1>
<p>Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having
fought to a standstill after years of conﬂict, orc and human tribes
sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the
terror of civilised lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by
marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud
chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their
full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their
worth among humans and other more civilised races. Many of these become
adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety
for their barbaric customs and savage fury.</p>
<h2 id="scarred-and-strong">Scarred and strong</h2>
<p>Half-orcs' greyish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws,
prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain
for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually
weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.</p>
<p>Orcs regard battle scars as tokens of pride and ornamental scars as
things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark an orc or half-orc as a
former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or
near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride,
recounting their past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living
among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in
shame.</p>
<h2 id="the-mark-of-gruumsh">The mark of Gruumsh</h2>
<p>The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the orcs, and even those orcs who
turn away from his worship can't fully escape his inﬂuence. The same is
true of half-orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of
their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Gruumsh in
their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them.
Others feel Gruumsh‘s exultation when they join in melee combat - and
either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs
are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they
embrace it or rebel against it.</p>
<p>Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage
doesn’t just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult
stings like acid and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly
and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures - feasting, drinking,
wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing - ﬁll their hearts with joy. They
tend to be short-tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action
than contemplation and to ﬁghting than arguing. The most accomplished
half-arcs are those with enough self-control to get by in a civilised
land.</p>
<h2 id="tribes-and-slums">Tribes and slums</h2>
<p>Half-orcs most often live among orcs. Of the other races, humans are
most likely to accept half-orcs, and half-orcs almost always live in
human lands when not living among orc tribes. Whether proving themselves
among rough barbarian tribes or scrabbling to survive in the slums of
larger cities, half-orcs get by on their physical might, their
endurance, and the sheer determination they inherit from their human
ancestry.</p>

<h2 id="half-orc-names">Half-Orc Names</h2>
<p>Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they
were raised. A half-orc who wants to fit in among humans might trade an
orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs with human names decide to
adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more
intimidating.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Male Orc Names: Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk,
Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk</p></li>
<li><p>Female Orc Names: Baggi, Emen, Engong, Kansif, Myev, Neega, Ovak,
Ownka, Shautha, Sutha, Vola, Volen, Yevelda</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="half-orc-traits">Half-orc traits</h2>
<p>Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc
ancestry</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-increase">Ability Score Increase</h3>
<p>Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score
increases by 1.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>Half-orcs mature at little faster than humans, reaching adulthood
around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75
years.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and
are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and
willing to live out their lives among them are usually evil.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range
from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<h3 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
<p>Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim
conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern
colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
<h3 id="menacing">Menacing</h3>
<p>You gain proﬁciency in the Intimidation skill.</p>
<h3 id="relentless-endurance">Relentless Endurance</h3>
<p>When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can
drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you
ﬁnish a long rest.</p>
<h3 id="savage-attacks">Savage Attacks</h3>
<p>When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can
roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to
the extra damage of the critical hit.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh,
grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but
is written in the Dwarvish script.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Grudging acceptance Each half-orc ﬁnds a way to gain
acceptance from those who hate orcs. Some are reserved, trying not to
draw attention to themselves. A few demonstrate piety and
good-heartedness as publicly as they can (whether or not such
demonstrations are genuine). And some simply try to be so tough that
others just avoid them.</p>
