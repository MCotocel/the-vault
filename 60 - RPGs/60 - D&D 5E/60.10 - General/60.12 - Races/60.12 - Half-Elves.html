<h1 id="half-elves">Half-Elves</h1>
<p>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither. half-elves
combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human
parents: human curiosity, inventiveness. and ambition tempered by the
reﬁned senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some
half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical
differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely
touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach
adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to
live as children. Many half-elves, unable to ﬁt into either society,
choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misﬁts and
outcasts in the adventuring life.</p>
<h2 id="of-two-worlds">Of two worlds</h2>
<p>To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human.
In height, they‘re on par with both parents, though they’re neither as
slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to
about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly
taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and
sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven
coloration and features lie somewhere between their human and elf
parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found
among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven
parents.</p>
<h2 id="diplomats-or-wanderers">Diplomats or wanderers</h2>
<p>Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in
human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities
in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are
sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They
enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly
understand what it is to live between these two worlds.</p>
<p>In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough
that one might live for years without meeting another. Some half-elves
prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as trappers,
foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilisation only
rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of
their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of
society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in
diplomatic roles or as swindlers.</p>

<h2 id="half-elf-names">Half-Elf Names</h2>
<p>Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to
emphasise that they don’t really fit in to either society, half-elves
raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among
elves often take human names.</p>
<h2 id="half-elf-traits">Half-elf traits</h2>
<p>Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and
some that are unique to half-elves.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-increase">Ability Score Increase</h3>
<p>Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of
your choice increase by 1.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood
around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often
exceeding 180 years.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value
both personal freedom andcreative expression, demonstrating neither love
of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others'
demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6
feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
<h3 id="darkvision">Darkvision</h3>
<p>Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim
conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can‘t discern
colour in darkness, only shades of grey.</p>
<h3 id="fey-ancestry">Fey Ancestry</h3>
<p>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic
can't pull you to sleep.</p>
<h3 id="skill-versatility">Skill Versatility</h3>
<p>You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>You can speak. read. and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language
of your choice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Excellent Ambassadors Many half-elves learn at an early age
to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and ﬁnding common ground.
As a race, they have elven grace without elven aloofness and human
energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors
and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side
suspects the half-elf of favouring the other)</p>
