<h1 id="dnd">dnd</h1>
<h1 id="halflings">Halflings</h1>
<p>The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place
to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing
armies; a blazing ﬁre and a generous meal; ﬁne drink and ﬁne
conversation. Though some halﬂings live out their days in remote
agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel
constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the
wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace,
food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an
dirt road or a raft ﬂoating downriver.</p>
<h2 id="small-and-practical">Small and practical</h2>
<p>The diminutive halﬂings survive in a world full of larger creatures
by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offence. Standing about 3
feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to
survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars
and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40
and 45 pounds.</p>
<p>Halﬂings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their
hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel
eyes. Halﬂing men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among
them and moustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable,
and practical clothes, favouring bright colours.</p>
<p>Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're
concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for
ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halﬂings keep their treasures locked
in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for
ﬁnding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little
patience for dithering.</p>
<h2 id="kind-and-curious">Kind and curious</h2>
<p>Halﬂings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds
of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home,
harbouring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them
usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship,
wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple
things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.</p>
<p>Halﬂings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing
suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean
times</p>
<h2 id="blend-into-the-crowd">Blend into the crowd</h2>
<p>Halﬂings are adept at ﬁtting into a community of humans, dwarves, or
elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their
inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halﬂings to avoid
unwanted attention.</p>
<p>Halﬂings work readily with others, and they are loyal to their
friends, whether halﬂing or otherwise. They can display remarkable
ferocity when their friends, families, or communities are
threatened.</p>
<h2 id="pastoral-pleasantries">Pastoral pleasantries</h2>
<p>Most halﬂings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms
and well-kept groves. They rarely build kingdoms of their own or even
hold much land beyond their quiet shires. They typically don't recognise
any sort of halﬂing nobility or royalty, instead looking to family
elders to guide them. Families preserve their traditional ways despite
the rise and fall of empires.</p>
<p>Many halﬂings live among other races, where the halﬂings’ hard work
and loyal outlook offer them abundant rewards and creature comforts.
Some halﬂing communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons of
guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.</p>
<h2 id="exploring-opportunities">Exploring opportunities</h2>
<p>Halﬂings usually set out on the adventurer's path to defend their
communities, support their friends, or explore a wide and wonder-ﬁlled
world. For them, adventuring is less a career than an opportunity or
sometimes a necessity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!note] Affable and positive Halﬂings try to get along with everyone
else and are loath to make sweeping generalisations - especially
negative ones. --- Dwarves: “Dwarves make loyal friends, and you can
count on them to keep their word. But would it hurt them to smile once
in a while?"</p>
<p>Elves: “They're so beautiful! Their faces, their music, their grace
and all. It's like they stepped out of a wonderful dream. But there's no
telling what's going on behind their smiling faces - surely more than
they ever let on."</p>
<p>Humans: "Humans are a lot like us. really. At least some of them are.
Step out of the castles and keeps, go talk to the farmers and herders
and you'll ﬁnd good, solid folk. Not that there's anything wrong with
the barons and soldiers - you have to admire their conviction. And by
protecting their own lands, they protect us as well."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="halfling-names">Halfling Names</h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="halfling-traits">Halfling traits</h2>
<p>Your halﬂing character has a number of traits in common with all
other halﬂings.</p>
<h3 id="ability-score-increase">Ability Score Increase</h3>
<p>Your Dexterity score increases by 2.</p>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives
into the middle of his or her second century.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Most halﬂings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and
kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression.
They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the
support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>Halﬂings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your
size is Small.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your base walking speed is 25 feet.</p>
<h3 id="lucky">Lucky</h3>
<p>When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw,
you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.</p>
<h3 id="brave">Brave</h3>
<p>You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>
<h3 id="halﬂing-nimbleness">Halﬂing Nimbleness</h3>
<p>You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size
larger than yours.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>You can speak. read, and write Common and Halﬂing. The Halﬂing
language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others.
They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature.
Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halﬂings speak
Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through
which they are travelling.</p>
<h3 id="subrace">Subrace</h3>
<p>The two main kinds of halfling, lightfoot and stout, are more like
closely related families than true subraces. Choose one of these
subraces.</p>
<h4 id="lightfoot">Lightfoot</h4>
<p>As a lightfoot halﬂing, you can easily hide from notice, even using
other people as cover. You're inclined to be affable and get along well
with others. In the Forgotten Realms, lightfoot halﬂings have spread the
farthest and thus are the most common variety.</p>
<p>Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halﬂings, and
often dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life. In the
world of Greyhawk, these halﬂings are called hairfeet or
tallfellows.</p>
<h5 id="ability-score-increase-1">Ability Score Increase</h5>
<p>Your Charisma score increases by 1.</p>
<h5 id="naturally-stealthy">Naturally Stealthy</h5>
<p>You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature
that is at least one size larger than you.</p>
<h4 id="stout">Stout</h4>
<p>As a stout halfling, you're hardier than average and have some
resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have dwarven blood. In the
Forgotten Realms, these halﬂings are called stronghearts, and they're
most common in the south.</p>
<h5 id="ability-score-increase-2">Ability Score Increase</h5>
<p>Your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
<h5 id="stout-resilience">Stout Resilience</h5>
<p>You have advantage on sawing throws against poison, and you have
resistance against poison damage.</p>
