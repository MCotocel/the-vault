<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>Speaks their entire stream of consciousness aloud (i.e. "You want a
healing potion? I have healing potions... they were quite expensive when
I went to acquire them, but I thought it would be an absolutely a
worthwhile investment, and I suppose I was right, but where did I put
them? Not by the trail rations, no...)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>Drawls the endings of words out (good for evil or suspicious
characters), a la Smaug</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>A good mix with #2 is tonal shifting. Starting your voice off higher
and deepening it as the sentence progresses. Kind of hard to describe in
writing, but it has a way of making sentences sound very final and
decisive. Most of Benny C's sentences in the previously linked clip do
kind of what I'm talking about.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td>Vocal fry. It's not just a teen phenomenon! Obviously it can be, and
it might be a fun voice for a bored shopkeeper('s child who has to man
the store for a day), but if done with a bit of a drawl, it can make a
very fun villain voice.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5</td>
<td>Building on #4, someone who draws out their syllables. Vocal fry
helps enunciate this, but it can come off as a bit evil, a bit sexy, a
bit dramatic if you do it right. Maybe even a little British, idk. Lends
itself well to people who speak slowly.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>6</td>
<td>Just swear a bunch. Punctuate every sentence with a swear, or even
toss them in between words for emphasis. Pepper them about where they
barely make sense. Make the NPC a really sweet, loveable child with a
filthy mouth.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>7</td>
<td>Speak... very... slowly. Or... have long pauses throughout your...
speech. I like this for characters who are very thoughtful or, better
yet, ones who have no fucking clue what they're doing. Got a newly
appointed captain of the guard? Well, she has no idea what her actual
job entails, so she spends a lot of time listening and ESPECIALLY
thinking hard about what she says. She has to pick her words carefully,
lest they be her last.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>8</td>
<td>Doesn't think before they speak. This is a bit more of an
improv-based "voice", but it can be fun to have someone, especially a
high-ranking official, who says the first thing that comes to mind and
either everyone is tired of their shit, or they all are smart enough to
hold their tongues (or both). Pepper this with a bit of a raised
voice/someone who yells a little bit, and either charges ahead with what
they say, or is forced to renege every few sentences because they fucked
up.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>9</td>
<td>Never makes eye contact. This is a little harder via video or even,
god forbid, just voice chat, so I'm sorry for that! But this is a good
one for either anti-social characters, brusque characters, annoyed
guards, or just people who are a little more flighty and not good at
paying attention to the here and now. Lean more into the brusque, short
sentences for an annoyed/anti-social vibe, or a slow, dreamy voice if
you're looking for that. Have fun with it! Make a show of not looking
your players in the eye!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>10</td>
<td>Rambling. Not to be confused with stream of consciousness, rambling
can be trailing off into anything at all, as opposed to a personal
narration. Maybe they go off on how they feel about something, or into a
story that they were reminded of, or even a prophetic dream they had.
Ramblers may need to be shut up, lest they just keep talking, so maybe
cut yourself off unless you have a party who will do it for you.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>11</td>
<td>This is more a subsection of #10, but someone who goes off-tangent
into storytelling. Be they an adventurer who has lived a long and
storied life, or a kooky librarian who's been reading too much lately,
going into storytelling is a nice way to maybe do a bit of soft
worldbuilding, or just annoy your players a little, but in a charming
way. Also, this can be a fun elderly character, if done right!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>12</td>
<td>Speaking in tandem/cutting each other off. This is a bit tougher,
but can be done well if you get cadence down. Maybe you have close
twins, or even a long-time married couple! They finish each other's
sentences, though one tends to speak slowly and deliberately, while the
other can barely contain their words, and often ends up spilling over
before their other half has finished their sentence! Pitch might help
here, giving one character a bit of a higher voice and the other a
little deeper one. That, or making one person the cheery labrador
retriever (excitable, happy, game for anything) while the other is the
dour housecat (grouchy, talks slower, has a tendency to mumble).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>13</td>
<td>Stutter! Don't do this in a mocking way. It doesn't have to be
unintelligible, as many stutterers don't stutter in the way many people
understand them to (repeating one syllable a few times etc.). Some more
serious stutters involve simply trying to shape your mouth to make the
right sound, so there can be a lot of pauses in your sentences as you
try to form the word. Be nice if doing this voice! Stutterers go through
a lot of shit in this big wide world, so don't make a mockery of
it.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>14</td>
<td>Huge grin, big jovial attitude all the time, regardless of the
situation. This one is less a voice than an attitude, but I think always
smiling can be a kind of voice/tone. Especially for an evil character,
approaching every conversation with a bright smile that refuses to crack
can be as sinister as spinning around in a chair and stroking a
cat.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>15</td>
<td>Speaks as if trying to spit the words out. Sentences should be short
and punctuated in a way that's as if they're being hurled at your
players. Not the kind of person to hold a conversation with for very
long.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>16</td>
<td>Overly loud. Maybe they're drunk! Maybe they're hard of hearing!
Maybe they're both, because they're in a loud tavern! Either way, come
at your players fast by yelling at them through a microphone, and watch
them all jump in their seats as you holler at them! Fun for the whole
family.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>17</td>
<td>Swap pronunciations of letters. This is a little weird and may
require finegaling, and also comes dangerously close (to me) to an
accent, but try swapping some sounds with each other. For instance, swap
all 'S' sounds with 'Z' to make a strange, unplaceable accent. It might
even go undetected for a bit, but you can spice it up by making the
character struggle with Common a bit. And on that note:</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>18</td>
<td>Have someone who doesn't know Common as a 'first language'. Ask for
definitions of words, or pause while trying to remember words. Talk
around a word (instead of house, for an aarakocra, say 'Large covered
nest', or something similar). Pause a lot!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>19</td>
<td>Interrupt sentences in your gusto to speak! This one may get
annoying if done too much, so pair it with a lot of excited head nods or
quiet exclamations. Trip over your own words or skip over words entirely
and go back for them two sentences later. This can also be done in a
serious conversation, potentially by a character who knows a lot about
what's being discussed. Think of those movie scenes where people begin
to throw ideas back and forth, and finally culminate in saying one thing
in unison, or whatever. That idea, but in a dialogue with your
players.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>20</td>
<td>Randomly repeat words throughout your sentences. There might be room
for accidental misinterpretation (saying 'not' twice in a row, for
example), but there probably shouldn't be any rhyme or reason to the
words you repeat. Or you can disregard that and decide that you only
repeat the words at the beginning or end of your sentences. This one
isn't a stutter, but more of a vocal tic. You could even mutter the
second word, softly, but that also plays on some weird stereotypes
around depictions of schizophrenia, so I'd recommend just having the
doubling of words be something that's woven into sentences. That also
makes it a little more weird and interesting.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>21</td>
<td>Building off #21, randomly repeat your players' words. This can
either be like a shopkeeper deep in thought, trying to recall something
and using your players' words to stimulate their memory, or maybe it's
more sinister... or maybe it's just a vocal tic! Up to you.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>22</td>
<td>Slur your words a bit. I don't mean like in a drunk way (though
that's fun too!), but more like making every possible word a
contraction, and then making your sentence one long word. Kinda hard to
describe in writing, but it can be done better by stressing the first
word and then just blending the rest into one kind of rushed
sentence.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>23</td>
<td>Cut off your own sentences part way through. Maybe your character
forgot the rest of their sentence? Maybe they pick it up from where they
left off three seconds ago. Maybe they start a fully new sentence! Who
knows! Be prepared for a bit of frustration from your players. Also a
fun voice tic for elderly people!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>24</td>
<td>Make other sounds with your mouth. Click your tongue while thinking,
whistle to get others' attention, smack your lips a bit. If you're a
bird-humanoid, click your mouth a few times. I like this for a bard
(have them whistle a bit while your players are talking, if you can
whistle!), or someone who is physically incapable of being quiet. Don't
bring this NPC on a heist!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>25</td>
<td>Speak softly. Another one that translates badly over video/voice
call, but if you speak in a bit of a whisper, you'll definitely catch
your players' attention, if only because they have to lean in real close
to hear you. For added fun, if they ask you to speak up, just raise your
voice a teeny tiny bit and tell them you're now shouting.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>26</td>
<td>Throw in a lot of filler words, like 'um' or 'uh', and maybe another
nervous tic, like snapping your fingers of tapping your thigh. That, or
your character isn't nervous at all, they just need time to think of
what they're gonna say, and those filler words are how they fill space
when they need to think.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>27</td>
<td>Draw out your 'S' sounds. Good for lizardfolk, dragons, kobolds, or
maybe even dragonborn!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>28</td>
<td>Constant scowl on their face. This also doesn't translate well to
voice calls, but if you keep your face in a scowl, it does kinda change
your voice, so it might work. Mumbling works here.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>29</td>
<td>Just woke up. Maybe today is a slow day at the shop! Maybe your
party burst into their home at 3 AM! Either way, you're grouchy and
you're yawning a lot. You're also irritable and unable/unlikely to take
any bullshit, and that includes haggling. Better for a one-off
character, or I guess someone with narcolepsy.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>30</td>
<td>Speak in rhymes! This might be a tough one, so maybe keep it a short
NPC (tho undoubtedly your players will want to make them talk as much as
possible) but could be very fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>31</td>
<td>Making way too much eye contact. Best if in person, but can also be
done by eerily staring into the camera on video and not blinking a
lot.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>32</td>
<td>Tack on some extra syllables to words! To make it easier, tack on
syllables to specific sounds, so for example, every time you say the
'oo' sound, add an 'S'. That would make: "Youse never know what to
dooz!" as opposed to, "You never know what to do!" Might take a bit of
work to get down, but very distinct!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>33</td>
<td>Speaks in gibberish or quickly, with a bit of a slur and some
unfamiliar phrasing.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>34</td>
<td>Enunciates specific letters/enunciate every word extremely clearly.
For example, making the 'bedder' actually pronounced with the double 'T'
sound. Or, a way to emphasize this would be to make all 'S' sounds the
same. For example, instead of 'should', make it a flat 'S' sound, like
in snake (Sood). An example sentence would become: "That snake
<em>sood</em> be killed before it <em>iss</em> joined by another." Drop
the 'Z' sound and the 'Sh' sound. Might take a while to practice, but
could be neat!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>35</td>
<td>Makes every sentence into a question? I guess? Might be hard to hold
a long conversation in this tone? Okay, I'll stop now?</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>36</td>
<td>Only speaks while breathing in. This is a tough one to say long
sentences on, unless you take a while to pause a lot in your sentences.
Could be a good voice for answering those pesky 'Speak With Dead' spells
that your cleric is always running around and doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>37</td>
<td>Sighs a lot throughout sentences. Maybe they're lovelorn! Maybe
they're just like that! Maybe you're playing a gritty Winnie the Pooh
campaign and you're Eeyore! The possibilities abound!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>38</td>
<td>Drops article adjectives (a, an, the). This is in line with making
it sound like a character is foreign or doesn't speak Common natively.
It's actually a pretty common stumbling block for Russian speakers
learning English. Especially effective if you do it inconsistently.
<em>(Instead of "I went to the store and saw a cat," try "I went to
store and saw cat.")</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>39</td>
<td>Uses prepositions incorrectly. Also would be a key for a non-native
speaker. Once again, common real world hurdle for people learning a new
language because every language uses these differently and kind of
arbitrarily. As an aside, prepositions are words that were introduced to
me as your relation to a box (i.e. over, under, through, around, on
etc.) An example would be: <em>"I went to the post office,"</em>
becoming <em>"I went on the post office."</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>40</td>
<td>Speaking in third person (or even second person? i.e. Speaking about
themselves, "You need to get more ingredients for your potions. Would
the kind adventurers help you find some goodberries for a healing
potion? You would perhaps give them a good discount.").</td>
</tr>
