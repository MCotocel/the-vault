During the performance one of the dancers lunges at one of the party

the spectacle.</td>

seemingly grown from the very ground itself. All of the figures are
depictions of body horror and some spectators have been driven mad or
died after looking at them for too long.</td>

and very dangerous. Inside is a lifeform.</td>

<td>The party is asked to investigate a local art gallery as the last
known location of a model that has disappeared. The party finds
extremely life like statues of various people, missing model included,
and discovers the sculptor is a Maedar, with a pet Basilisk, trying to
replicate his dead mate (a Medusa).</td>
</tr>

paint fumes trigger a spell that sends the party into a collective
Dream. They must find their way out and defeat the Artist-Wizard and his
pet Nothic before they are bled dry (to fuel a hideous ritual).</td>

parks, and the party is encouraged to join, and are asked to put on some
simple costumes. Upon doing so, they are swapped with hidden Clones, who
continue the performance, while the party is teleported to an
underground prison full of holding cells. There are dozens of other
trapped citizens there.</td>

and university students alike. The song has a 10% to transfer an
audio-parasite, that will drive the singer mad and ultimately into a
catatonic state over the course of 7 days. During this time they will be
compelled to sing the “hook” over and over, in the hopes of infecting
any nearby listeners.</td>

<td>A master tattooist has set up a temporary shop on the fringes of the
city. For a hefty fee, the customer will receive an exquisite piece of
personal art, and on full moons, the tattoo will be able to sense the
presence of magic, poisons, disease, or creature types (DMs choice). The
master will leave after 24 hours, never to be seen again and the tattoo
will fade completely after 30 days.</td>

paint any place the customer desires. For a fee, she can make the
painting a one-time portal to that place. The portals always go to the
wrong location (this is discovered after travel has occurred).</td>

<td>A local homeless man, who mimes for money along the Promenade and in
the Park, suddenly finds his invisible walls and pretend ropes are real.
Passersby run into invisible walls of force left behind by him, people
are dragged to him by his invisible rope, and he now hides in a corner
of the park, afraid he will hurt others with this newfound power. The
local Telekinesis Guild (bunch of filthy impostors and con artists,
mostly) are furious that he has what they secretly do not, and has put a
bounty on him, paid upon live delivery to their guild house.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>18</td>
<td>A local street band is performing the show of their life and the
music has become magical. Any Bards present will be able to “draw” 1-3
new spells from the performance. All others will be Blessed for the next
48 hours.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>19</td>
<td>An artist has set up a crude telescope, pointing at the ground. For
a small fee, you can look through the telescope and see a miniature
world, full of tiny blue humanoids in a stone-age environment. The
telescope is enchanted with a very detailed Major Illusion spell that
allows the humanoids to be seen, and is also Cursed to drive the viewer
mad by causing them to see the tiny blue humanoids everywhere they go.
The curse will begin 24 hours after using the telescope and will persist
for 30 days or until the victim goes mad, or dies. The Curse will
manifest the humanoids as watching, then menacing, then threatening,
then murderous.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td>20</td>
<td>Some Elven sculptors have set up a “Century Garden” - plinths of
stone overhung by apparatus with funnels in different angles and
locations that drip acids onto the stone - slowly forming the final form
of the artists vision. The artist is selling tickets (valid in 100
years) to attend the ceremony.</td>

<td>A local tavern is showcasing a new lager and a spruiker is on the
streets handing out "1/2 off" coupons to passersby. The party is given
"2 free drinks" coupons on purpose by the NPC. A stranger is waiting
inside that wants to talk to the party.</td>

of Bacchus and has caused the party to spill into the streets where it
has been pulling in passersby. The party is caught up in the crowd.</td>

party’s allies goes missing and was last seen there. The club is a coven
of Sorcerers and every night they sacrifice a kidnapped customer to try
to summon an Eldritch Horror.</td>

<td>A hot club in town is secretly run by vampires. Cover charge is 1
pint of blood. Thralls being thralls, one of them talks, and a Hunter
has gotten wind of the nest. The party will see him interrogating a
thrall and escalating to torture.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td>A drunken brawl spills out of a tavern near the party. The fight is
brutal, involving makeshift weapons and ends up overtaking the party. If
they do not flee, during the fracas the party notices that one of the
brawlers is biting his opponents and swallowing the flesh. If they do
flee, they hear the next day that a pile of half-eaten bodies was
discovered in the aftermath. A new zombie-master has come to town.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>6</td>
<td>While out drinking, the party sees a Silver Elf enter the tavern,
and time slows to 50% of its current speed for all but the party and
Elf, who remain at 100%. The Elf asks the party if they would like to
play a game of chess. If they say no, the Elf vanishes, and time returns
to normal. If they agree they must wager a precious/strong/important
memory against the answer to any question. The Elf has an INT modifier
of +4 and a +4 proficiency in gaming. Upon the conclusion of the game,
the Elf vanishes and time returns to normal. The bar patrons never see
the Elf.</td>

violence and 2 end up dead. On one of the deceased bodies is a treasure
map that leads to a guarded vault in the wilderness.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>8</td>
<td>A particularly virulent STD is going around the brothels. Over the
course of 72 hours it turns the afflicted into a receptor for mental
dominance from a powerful psion. The “Mind Taker” uses these puppets to
rob the afflicted and deliver their valuables to a guarded location.
Then the psion drains the puppet of its final mental faculties and
stores it as an energy source for later. The bodies are then destroyed
using a Rod of Disintegration. One of the party’s allies (or a party
member themselves) has come down with a case of “The Threads” (so named
for the red lines of infection radiating from the genitalia into the
legs and torso.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>9</td>
<td>A dance club has been cursed by a witch to afflict some (30%) of the
customers with “Otiluke’s Irresistible Dance”. Some patrons have been
dropping dead from it and the club owners are covering it up by secretly
burying the bodies in the basement and drugging the witnesses. The party
is present for this or one of their allies goes missing.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>10</td>
<td>A man attempting to throw a party so massive he will officially
become “the God of Partying” wants the players to help him throw an
absolute rager. If they help, he will remember them fondly when he
reaches godhood. The party could overrun the region/city.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>11</td>
<td>The party finds a club throwing a rager in the party’s honour. All
night, people toast the party members, dance with them, and celebrate.
No one in the party has to pay for drinks. The next day, the party gets
the bill for everyone's drinks. The tavern was told the event was for
the party and would be paid for by them as well.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>12</td>
<td>A new fad in the high-end taverns of the city, catering to young
noblemen with too much money and not enough sense, is a drink called The
Kiss. One part grain alcohol, one part pufferfish venom - a shot of this
causes hallucinations and numbness, in addition to more than the usual
drunkenness. Two young men, heirs to fortunes and titles in the court,
have died in the last two nights. Word is they drank too many of these.
The noble families want blood, and put bounties on all known bartenders
serving This Kiss. The guard don’t want a riot on their hands if they
interfere with the Mixologist’s Guild, the most powerful multinational
trade guild in the world. A representative from the Crown has summoned
the party, to discreetly investigate the explosive situation.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>13</td>
<td>A group of drunks stumble towards the party and push through/past
them. During this, the party will each be subject to a Pickpocket
attempt (+8 Sleight of Hand). If discovered, the “drunks” are a pack of
rogues who “own” this territory. If challenged, they will flee and
return with a number of Thugs equal to the number of party members.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>14</td>
<td>A grifter comes up to the party and bets that they can guess “where
you got your boots/shoes”. The answer is “on your feet” (where the
footwear currently is). The grifter will demand a small amount of cash
after this, and will become hostile if denied or hassled.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>15</td>
<td>An avatar of Bacchus/Dionysus appears in the area and begins a
Revel. Those who hear the music or see the dancing/drinking must save vs
Wisdom (DC 20) or join in. The Revel will last for 72-96 hours and leave
partygoers with 3 levels of Exhaustion (and be many miles from where it
started).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>16</td>
<td>A Dwarven “thrashgnome” band is throwing an impromptu concert on the
roof of a local tavern. The noise is deafening and a large brawl will
erupt after awhile - during the fracas an object will find itself at the
feet of one of the party members. It is a powerful Fetish that was
stolen from a Witch (who has been seeking it, and is nearby).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>17</td>
<td>The party enters a tavern to discover their money is “no good” and
they are suddenly crowned “Lager Kings/Queens” for the night, and feted
and welcomed by each individual tavern patron. The party will, as the
sun rises, be poisoned by the insinuative poison that was in each
successive drink, and if they fail a Con check vs a high DC, they will
be magically Sleep’ed and find themselves strapped to a basement altar
for a hatchling Gold Dragon to feed upon. If they succeed on the check,
they are very ill and considered Incapacitated for the next 24
hours.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>18</td>
<td>A new tavern has appeared in the area, and will vanish after the
night’s festivities to appear in a random location in the world the next
night. The tavern patrons are all Fey, and this is the “Wandering Druid
Pub”.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>19</td>
<td>A dealer is handing out “free tokes” of a new narcotic. The narcotic
is powerful and hallucinatory, but harmless otherwise, except for the
addiction rate, which is near 100%. A Con check vs a high DC is
required. If failed, the user must take the drug again in the next 24
hours or suffer 2 levels of Fatigue. Every day without the drug
thereafter confers another level of Fatigue. If the check is passed,
they will become violently nauseous every time they take the drug
again.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>20</td>
<td>A group of Gnomish Brewmasters have set up a tasting booth on the
street and are giving out free samples of “Old Brown Mare” - a powerful
stout that has a tiny side effect - 10% of the imbibers are shrunk to
Gnomish height for 24 hours.</td>

<td>An extraordinary amount of the richer folk of the town have gathered
on the plaza. Gregory’s Golden Garments has arrived back in town from
one of his far-off trading junkets. He brings the most exclusive
textiles and materials to town, and the auction has started
(dragon-skins, silk, etc.). During the auction, someone purchases a rare
bolt of material and the party finds it in their room later, with
instructions to hide it. If they don’t, a group of Assassins come
looking for it. If they do, they will be contacted by a mysterious agent
who asks them to transport it far away for a hefty fee.</td>

someone has poisoned the foodstuffs and half the city is sick with

these pamphlets is pushed on the party.</td>

them to sell a weapon for her, as she cannot. She explains that the
weapon is Cursed and will not allow itself to be sold by the owner. If
the party agrees, she looks visible relieved and hands the item over.
Now the weapon belongs to the party member who took it (and it cannot be
sold). The item is a -1 weapon.</td>

<td>A small purse keeps whispering at a player for them to buy it. It
remains silent when others are observing it and refuses to talk if it

hide it from pickpockets, and offer insight) if they give it something
in return (it wants costly gemstones).</td>

<td>Every store and restaurant the party enters seems to be run by the
same person. If confronted, they laugh and say they “get that all the

forced together, they will become violent and the others will run out to
join them.</td>

promises “75% off all Adventuring Gear” at a local merchant. The
merchant is very chatty and inquisitive and will press the party for
information about where they are going next. The merchant then sells
this information to a gang of rogues who will follow the party and

party member is Cursed with a particularly nasty form of
melancholia.</td>

offers to make their “dreams come true” if they will sell their soul.
The man/woman will cast a real Wish on behalf of the party member (which
works without the usual DM fuckery, but will expire in 1 year, and a
group of Devils will appear to collect the player’s soul). If refused,
the man/woman will leave, but if confronted, they will flee. The
man/woman is a mortal humanoid who simply shills for a Crossroads

<td>While shopping for arrows/projectiles, the merchant offers the party
a “one-time deal” of some special projectiles that are “guaranteed to
strike their target every time” and will demonstrate this quality in a
shooting lane set up in the back of the shop. The projectile will work
as promised within the shop itself, without limit, but outside the shop,
the first 3 only will work as promised and the rest will automatically
fail-to-hit. If confronted later, the shopkeeper will claim ignorance
