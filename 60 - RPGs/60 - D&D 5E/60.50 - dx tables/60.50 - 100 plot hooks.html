fight a duel of honour.</td>

<td>The party finds a fully charged (100 uses) Wand of Wonder. It cannot
be thrown away, and compels the user to point the wand and shout the
command word ("SHICKETYSHAK!") every time the owner enters combat or the
boundaries of a village, town or city. Once 100 charges have been
expended, the Wand teleports 100 miles away, and fully recharges.</td>

Underdark to terrorise a village that is slowly losing the fight.</td>

Quicklings. There are skull-dangles throughout the forest and many

40 years previously.</td>

<td>A murderous cabal of Wereseals (yes they existed in 2e) have camped
in some coastal caves. They are preying on passing ships as well as
passing caravans. One of them wears a headband that keeps it in
telepathic contact with its true master, an offshore Aboleth.</td>

One chieftain wears a cursed ring that drives the owner to obsessively
eat the flesh of its own species.</td>

underground to take shelter. There they find a mysterious cave tucked
away in a side passage - the bodies of two strange races held in
stasis.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>21</td>
<td>The party finds a ray gun. It fires twice reliably, and then only
ever again if the owner is near death (under 1/4 of total HP). Range:
120 Damage: 2d6 necrotic and 5% chance to disintegrate target. This
automatically works on a critical hit. The gun will function 1d20+1
times before burning out. It cannot be repaired. Its owner, a young
Illithid hunter, may come looking for it.</td>

<td>A serial graffiti artist has been creating disturbing works of art
on local buildings and the some of the residents have had psychological
breaks after looking at them for too long.</td>

<td>23</td>
<td>The All Fool's Day Parade appears on the horizon. The King of Fools
has many followers, all of them quite mad, but jolly. Some hundreds
walking, riding, operating strange contraptions, come closer. Chaotic,
wild music and singing, sinuous and whirling dancers may just draw the
party along for a celebration that will last days, possibly weeks before
the party is released, forever changed.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>24</td>
<td>Two boys are fighting over a travelling satchel in the middle of the
road. A squirrel is perched on the case and is watching the fight, very
agitated, and chittering loudly. Overhead a jackdaw swoops one boy again
and again, making lots of noise.</td>
</tr>

<td>Reports of a girl lost in the nearby area. They say she had gone
missing before, and had been found in a local valley, stone cold and
refusing to speak.</td>
</tr>

<td>26</td>
<td>A group of thieves have set up a travelling medicine show, selling
patent medicines and manuals of healthy living. They are drugging the
wealthy who stop by, and replacing them with members of a tribe of
doppelgangers who have threatened the gang with death if they do not
comply.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>27</td>
<td>One of the party wakes up with bloody hands and a letter in their
pocket. The letter is written in a rare language, and is printed on
human skin. Its contents are a lie, and are just the beginning of a
campaign of psychological torture by a leprechaun that has latched onto
the player and who remains nearby, invisible.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>28</td>
<td>A huge blackened circle of scorched and burnt earth and trees. In
the centre of the circle is the body of a paladin. In his hand is a Holy
Avenger. The Avenger is awakened. Its name is [insert cool name
here]</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>29</td>
<td>A collector has decided one of the party members should belong to
her collection of beautiful specimens. The collector starts leaving
gifts for the party member to find, becoming increasingly romantic,
until one night when the collector (use an intelligent outsider) comes
for her prize.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>30</td>
<td>A drunken sailor tells tale of his ship that was taken by "reavers",
murderous cannibals who ripped his crewmates apart. He is lying. It
wasn't his ship. But a pack of kuo-toa have been plundering the local
shipping lanes and soon they will grow bored of waiting for prey and
attack the nearby population.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>31</td>
<td>Tornado!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>32</td>
<td>A local pie-eating contest is being held. The prize is a small Bag
of Pies, a minor magic item that conjures 1 type of any kind of fruit
pie per day. The entry price is 20 coins.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>33</td>
<td>A dog barks at the party, insistently. Tries to get the party to
follow. If they do, the dog will lead them to a ramshackle cabin where
the dogs friends, a group of Jackalwere (use stats, but just describe as
particular dog breed), who have been doing this to travellers for a
while, and have amassed a decent pile of treasure.</td>

forth, measuring and collecting samples of everything (including
lifeforms)</td>

<td>A planar resonance occurs and forces open a True Gate to the
demi-plane of Ravenloft (The Mists)</td>

and are pursued relentlessly</td>

<td>At a crossroads, on a hill, near a forest, a family of Ankheg are
engaged in an all out war with a large force of Aarakocra. The bird-folk
send a scout to determine the party's intentions.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>38</td>
<td>Tidal Wave!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>39</td>
<td>A bronze dagger, rusty with age, is lying in the dirt of a
wilderness crossroads. It is the last memory of a Nothic, bound to the
old blade. The dagger is actually +1 due to its masterwork quality, but
the Nothic will whisper insane threats and ramblings of nonsense, while
promising untold power if the user will only free him. This cursed blade
can be destroyed as any artefact would.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>40</td>
<td>The Dance of the Skeletons, a celebration of the Deity of the Dead,
marked by debauchery and music, has been interrupted by a huge swarm of
Peryton, come to feed in the breeding season.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>41</td>
<td>A noise, getting louder and louder becomes a human falling towards
the party's position at terminal velocity. The human misses the party
when hitting the ground, creating a 10' hole and knocking the party
prone. 50/50% chance the human has actually survived.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>42</td>
<td>A group of men burst out of the nearby tavern, fighting bloodily
with knives and skillets, chairs and broken tankards. The fighting
engulfs the party.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>43</td>
<td>A small boy appears in the party's camp one night, sitting by the
fire. He never speaks and cannot be touched, not through being
incorporeal, but through a repulsion field that is beyond 30th level
magic. The boy stays one hour and then vanishes. This event occurs every
night for a week. On the last night one of the players finds a ring on
their finger. This ring contains 1 dose of a poison that will kill any
creature in the known realms without a saving throw. It also kills the
poisoner.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>44</td>
<td>A bard's camp has been set up, and a wooden stage is filled with a
group of 6 minstrels singing and playing music. A large crowd has
gathered and are clapping and stomping. An 18th level rogue is in the
crowd. He has been hired to steal something from each of the party
members. His boss is a Medusa.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>45</td>
<td>A purple worm hole opens in civilisation overnight. If explored, a
new campaign should begin.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>46</td>
<td>An old woman approaches the party on the road. She is marked with
deformity and is overburdened with baggage. If the party approaches, the
ruse will be revealed to be a Doppelganger who is carrying 2 (or 4)
Mimics. They have been doing this a long time, but the DG hates his
slavery and will flee, leaving the mimics behind if the battle
turns.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>47</td>
<td>A local wood-elf tribe, known to be friendly in trade, have suddenly
shut their forest-gates and are turning all visitors away. Rumours of a
new sickness swirl.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>48</td>
<td>Ogres have gathered in a nearby valley in their teeming hundreds.
They have come to choose a new King, and the blood-games are about to
begin. They will last for 10 days and after the King is crowned, they
will rampage on the surrounding area, concentrating on live slaves and
food for the coronation feast. The King's name is always Bubba.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>49</td>
<td>Zombies, risen from a nearby graveyard are bothering travellers. If
the party intervenes they discover the zombies are asking for parley.
They are not mindless. They are not hungry. They are something new. They
need help.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>50</td>
<td>A threesome of Shadows have taken up residence in civilisation. They
have been unable to keep their hunger under control, and they have been
seen. The party discovers this when they enter the streets and find the
city in a religious fervour, the Temples preaching overtime at the Evil
in their Midst.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>51</td>
<td>A drunken musician tells one of the party that if they can play his
instrument (I swear this isn't entendre) as well as he can, he'll pay
them a large sum of money. If they agree, they have a 5% chance to
actually win. The musician goes first and always rolls a 20. If the
player loses, the musician becomes enraged and insults the player. If
they win, the musician laughs and screams and jumps up and down and runs
off leaving the player with the instrument. An angry (cursed) Pixie is
attached to the instrument. She will threaten and emasculate the user in
a tiny voice only the user can hear, and will only be silenced with
music. The cursed instrument can be cleansed by a high level divine
caster.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>52</td>
<td>A Gibbering Mouther rolls out of somewhere. It's delighted to see
the party, calling out "Hey! HEY FILTH! C'mere you filthy fucker! YEAH
YOU YA MEATBAG! FILTH! Hey, WAIT!". It will pursue the party until dawn,
and will fade with the rising sun, returning to the Demi-Plane of
Hunger. It will pursue the party for a week, appearing at dusk.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>53</td>
<td>A party of adventurers, bedraggled and bloodied, comes limping down
the road. They tell tale of a Formorian giant who has demanded a toll of
all who pass, and has killed every attempt to drive it out. A large
bounty is on the Formorian's head, offered by the head of a local
merchant's guild.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>54</td>
<td>Satyr's Gone Wild - its a hot summer night and the moon is full. A
large pack of Satyr are caught in a Bacchanalia, and are gathering up
stragglers as they go, but what the travelling party will soon find out
is that they are being hunted by a hunting tribe of Slaadi, who have
breached the plane nearby, with a Timed Gate.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>55</td>
<td>As the party is breaking camp, they are overrun by a huge group of
Crawling Claws. A nearby Necromancer (3 levels above party) is watching
nearby, and this is a test of his new creations. If spotted or the Claws
are defeated, he will flee to a nearby tower and attempt to contact his
master, an Oni.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>56</td>
<td>Ettercap have taken over a village. They have nearly all the humans
in a protected larder, and are watching for rescue. There is a nearby
Dryad who will aid the party if they look like they will aid the
village.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>57</td>
<td>One of the party members wakes up with a disease. It is highly
contagious, but will not kill the original host. The disease kills in 1
week, but if anyone who is infected remains in close proximity to the
original host after 7 days have gone by, they will benefit from the
change in the disease's chemistry, and be cured.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>58</td>
<td>A woman is blowing a whistle and screaming that someone has stolen
her daughter. She is pointing "that way" and will tell any who listen
that her little girl's name is Binta and she is only 6 years old. She
will try to accompany anyone who says they will help search. She will
keep thinking she sees her daughter. She is delusional. She has no
daughter.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>59</td>
<td>One morning a thick fog rolls in, ice cold and lingering. With it
brings a hunting pack of Merfolk. They are hunting "swine" as payback
for the Coast Wars in the distant past. The Merfolk's village is in a
nearby bay, and their predations will continue for several months. The
leader of the Merfolk is quite mad, driven so by the attempts to woo a
sexy fishlady. She is unimpressed with his antics.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>60</td>
<td>A merchant caravan is being swarmed with Goblin raiders. There are
hundreds of them, attacking at least 10 wagons. If chased off, they flee
towards an old wooden fort mouldering in the forest. A hobgoblin band of
exiles commands them.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>61</td>
<td>Everyone in the town is afflicted by horrible nightmares, night
after night, including the party. Its always the same dream for
everyone. The entire town burns to the ground and everyone devoured by
shadowy forms, unless the town sacrifices their children in a nearby
cave system. In a cavern under the town sits an imprisoned Yugoloth.
It's trapped in a circle of Binding, an impressive one, as the spell has
persisted after its owner's death (whose body lays just meters from the
trapped demon). The demon will hound the town until the townfolk perform
the Unbinding for him, and he can escape. The demon's true name is
Emman-Gutsucker</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>62</td>
<td>While the party is trying to be stealthy, they come across a small
swarm of Flumph flitting about, some resting on any nearby walls or
objects. A triad of Illithid is nearby, interrogating a local prisoner
for information on an artefact. The Flumph are simply feeding, and will
flee if interfered with or attacked. The three Mind Flayers are close
by, perhaps underground.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>63</td>
<td>The party comes across a pair of mating Owlbears, and a group of
Rangers who warn the party off and threaten violence if they interfere.
The Rangers give no names and will say no more, but attack if necessary
and flee to warn others if hard-pressed. The Rangers are, in fact,
Rogue/Wizards, who are trying to breed new aberrant species, and the two
"Owlbears" are, in fact, an Ettin and an Umber Hulk (yegods that's a
memorystain you can't erase), under a mass Illusion spell. This trick
will become apparent if the creatures are attacked.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>64</td>
<td>A pseudodragon appears in the party's camp, begging their help with
a terrible disaster to have befallen a local racial outpost. The dragon
makes wild and imaginative accusations of crazy mixed up creatures with
goofy, cartoon powers. IF the party decides to help, the PDragon leads
them on a wild goose chase, playing pranks on them and berating them for
moving so slowly. If the party declines, the PDragon takes immediate
offense, goes invisible, and actively interferes in the party's lives
(in the form of a -1 to every roll) for the next 7 days.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>65</td>
<td>A traveller on the road passes the news that the local mining
concern has put out a reward for anyone who will clean out their mines
from an infestation of Rust Monsters (and possibly a Roper (or two)).
The reward is substantial and a Wand of Ice (3 charges) will be given to
the party directly when they accept the challenge.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>66</td>
<td>A group of lost boys. A series of flyers asking for help, in
multiple towns. Then rumours they have returned, and sickness follows
them. A dread pestilence that causes all loss of appetite. This is just
the latest is a series of "pranks"by a Jubilex, the Faceless Lord (pg.
52 PHB 5e)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>67</td>
<td>During the night there is an explosion and a flash of light brighter
than daylight. A crater is nearby, and the body of a Planetar is
embedded at the core. It's Fiendquencher blade is missing. The Planetar
looks as if it has been torn apart by a million tiny cuts. There is a
handful of tiny machine parts, cogs and gears and flywheels near the
body, scattered about. It appears that a CE Tinker Gnome has,
incredibly, completed his Life Goal and slain one of the Celestial
Elites. The Gnome's army of micro-machines and the Gnome himself are
nearby, gloating.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>68</td>
<td>Earthquake!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>69</td>
<td>Hobgoblins have decided to lay siege to a local fortified town.
Their lines are loose for now, but will firm up over the next week and
their leader, a cunning Ogre, will definitely win this fight if no
outside help comes. It's the first of many campaigns by this growing
army.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>70</td>
