<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>01</td>
<td>A carefully crafted wooden box, decorated with silver inlay and dark
green velvet on the inside. It contains a set of small figurines
representing each PC, animal companion or familiar. They have been
sculpted with great details in a precious, well-polished deep dark
wood.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>02</td>
<td>A large and well balanced sword, with a PC’s distinctive emblem and
initials on the blade, inside a simple leather scabbard, soaked in dried
crimson. The hilt is engraved with a coat of arms of a border town that
has been recently destroyed. A young apprentice rode almost all the way
to the main city, injured by several arrows. He passed away a few miles
away from the city. The guards found him and brought the sword to the
party. The body was thrown in a mass grave.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>03</td>
<td>A bag of 4 dark, tainted metallic brooches with elite guard emblems,
along with a rolled painting of a small group of 7 young men and women
in uniform. The messenger informs the party that there are no family or
much friends for these guys, he/she thought maybe you were close. The
painting represents a graduation ceremony of a much larger prestigious
military academy, several years ago. One of the graduate is a friendly
martial class NPC, 2 or 3 others seem familiar. The graduates are from
different regions or races. Strangely, a few of them seem slightly
melancholic, and family members are nowhere to be seen.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>04</td>
<td>A used leather tool case with old, robust tinkering tools. The case
is embroidered with several dates, with thin leather straps. The oldest
is from roughly 90 years ago, the others are usually separated by 10-20
years each. The messenger confirms that some old artisan workshops are
passing their tools along from generation to generation to their most
talented students.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>05</td>
<td>A carefully folded war banner with the same colours as one of the
PCs uniform. The top is adorned with golden stars and the emblem of a
protection related god. The number of stars is equal to the number of
PCs. The bottom is partially torn and coated in pale ashes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>06</td>
<td>A thin intricate bracelet of curved green branches, tying itself
around a small stone engraved with an oak tree. Pressing the stone
allows to scry on a druid or ranger NPC refuge once a day. The place is
burnt to the ground with no vegetation remaining, and a single fragile
sprout is emerging from a grave covered in freshly moved rocks. The
bracelet itself is covered with undying white Jasmin flowers that always
regrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>07</td>
<td>A silver medallion with a dark leather lace and a small clasp on the
side. “Always worthy” is engraved on the back. The inscription seems
amateurish and indecisive. Inside the medallion is a tiny roll of
parchment, with a minuscule message written on it. It is an advice one
of the PCs gave an NPC on previous adventures.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>08</td>
<td>A pair of massive brass knuckles engraved with dwarven runes in a
simple cheap piece of cloth with an emblem of the thief guild. Although
the knuckles have been cleaned, some small splatters of dry blood still
remain in the corners. The messenger seems ready to explode in anger and
has tears in his/her eyes. He/she just says: “go give them payback” in a
broken voice, then turns around and leaves.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>09</td>
<td>A small metal casket with the emblem of an academy and the initials
of a mage or alchemist NPC. Inside is an old and chipped ivory smoking
pipe, with a pouch of dried luxury tobacco and a pair of copper
spectacles. These are broken into two pieces, damaged beyond
repair.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>10</td>
<td>A partially crushed and melted tiny child toy, made of cheap
blackened metal. A short letter with shaky handwriting signed from an
NPC reads “Make it count. Please.” The parent’s body is found on the
battlefield wearing a fresh conscript armour in the next few
sessions.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>11</td>
<td>A set of bent ornate brass messenger tubes sealed with red wax. Some
of the seals are broken. Inside are ink painting that the owner seemed
to carry with him/her. One tube contains a single roll of parchment
representing a peaceful scenery of the party enjoying a meal with an NPC
by the river, painted with black ink. The trees and river seems to
animate slightly.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>12</td>
<td>A single vibrating arrow with iridescent magic aura, enchanted to
deal additional damage to a unique creature of the DM’s choice. It is
enveloped in an elegant silk scarf, with a large polished black pebble
marked with a glyph. The pebble shows a vision of the past: a terrified
NPC seems to be in a barricaded underground passage, along with other
companions while muffled shouts and destruction are heard from outside.
She is wrapping the arrow in a hurry. She looks at the pebble, murmurs
“No regrets” with a faint smile, shoves it in the scarf and hands it to
a companion.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>13</td>
<td>A black dire bear’s fur, with a clasp pendant made of weird bones
enveloped in leather pouches. The pelt is strapped around the broken
skull of a giant beast, which looks like it took a massive blow from a
jagged blade. The messenger is a young tall barbarian, who speaks in
broken common and comments: “He/She died well, taking his/her enemy
down. The elders want his/her friend to be warm during the long
dark.”</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>14</td>
<td>A heavy tower shield, with a battle scene painted in deep blue and
red colours and a dwarven crest in the centre. The scene represents the
party in combat against a large monster from a previous adventure. The
PC to whom the gift is sent is portrayed dealing the final blow. The
crest in the centre is engraved “protector of light” in dwarven, and a
single distinctive diamond jewel is inserted in the centre. The PCs seem
to remember that the jewel was part of the armour set of an NPC.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>15</td>
<td>A large copper urn with a seaside landscape engraved, and a silver
crescent moon painted on its ivory lid. The urn is filled with pale
ashes, and the remains of broken horns belonging to a Tiefling NPC. The
messenger mentions NPC wanted the party to lead him/her to his last
resting place once this is all over. The location is currently occupied
by the enemy.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>16</td>
<td>A very old adventure book with golden leafs embroidered in the
cover, inside a gift wrap. The book is chanting the legend of a popular
ancient hero fighting against evil. On the first page is a short note
from an NPC mentor to a PC. ‘To my dear friend. For each period, its
darkest path and even brighter heroes. I am proud of what you have
accomplished, and even more of what we all stand for.’</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>17</td>
<td>A simple threadbare card game in a padded leather case. Aces, kings,
queens and jacks are representation of important members of a thief or
bard group that used them to confirm their identity. All special cards
are chipped, burnt, caked with dry blood and mud. The messenger reports
that they all died while evacuating civilians from a city under attack.
Some of their underlings collected the cards and asked to deliver them
to a PC before escaping.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>18</td>
<td>Pieces of shattered stained glass coming from the temple of a cleric
NPC, carefully wrapped in soft wool cloth. Although they are damaged,
most of the pieces are there, together with a relic belonging to a saint
initially represented with its god on the stained glass. It looks like
the person who sent it to the party believed the PCs would find it a new
home.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>19</td>
<td>An pet from an NPC, in a small cage or basket, rolled in the damaged
cape of its former master. The pet lost an eye and a leg/wing. It is
reluctant to leave its basket and is protective of the cape, but likes
to be petted by the PCs.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>20</td>
<td>A large, well-kept brown ledger with a list of ranks and names of
mercenaries, with deposits registered. Several have been listed ‘killed
in combat’, and names and addresses have been added for these. Inside
the cover is a key with a client number from the central bank. The
messenger communicates that an NPC wanted it delivered to a PC if he/she
died, because ‘they will know what to do’.</td>
