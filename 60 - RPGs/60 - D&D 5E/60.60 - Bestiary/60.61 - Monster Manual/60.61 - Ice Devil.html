<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The devil makes three attacks:
one with its bite, one with its claws, and one with its tail.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage
plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to

damage plus 10 (3d6) cold damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wall of Ice (Recharge 6).</em></strong> The devil
magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see
within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long
and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in
diameter. When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed
out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the
wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature
then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The wall
lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies. The wall
can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit
points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold,
necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it
leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.
Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn,
willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest
of the wall vanishes.</p>

<h2 id="ice-devil-1">Ice Devil</h2>
<p>Found most commonly on the cold layers of Stygia and Cania, ice
devils serve as commanders of the infernal armies of the Nine Hells,
tormenting lesser devils as an outlet for their anger and resentment.
Coveting the power of their pit fiend superiors, ice devils work
ceaselessly toward promotion, slaughtering the enemies of the Nine Hells
and claiming as many souls as they can for their archdevil masters.</p>
<p>Resembling a giant bipedal insect, an ice devil has clawed hands and
feet, powerful mandibles, and a long tail covered in razor-sharp spikes.
Some carry barbed spears whose icy touch can render a foe all but
helpless in combat.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="variant-ice-devil-spear">Variant: Ice Devil Spear</h5>
<p>Some ice devils have the following action options.</p>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The devil makes two attacks:
one with its spear and one with its tail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Ice Spear.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit,
reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage + 10 (3d6)
cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw, or for 1 minute, its speed is reduced by 10
feet; it can take either an action or a bonus action on each of its
turns, not both; and it can't take reactions. The target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to
the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator
extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of
Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power.
To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his
servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils
are spawned.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lords of Tyranny.</em></strong> Devils live to conquer,
enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority
over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil
faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity
for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen
understanding of how to use and abuse their power.</p>
<p>Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and
they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness,
turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the
Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers,
whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving
them to tyrannical actions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Obedience and Ambition.</em></strong> In accordance with
their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their
superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy
of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that
fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating
in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled.
This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus
appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking
fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave
like the sweetest ambrosia.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</em></strong> Devils are
confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by
way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains
with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making
such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and
positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a
contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will.
Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its
soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.</p>
<p>To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that
creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the
fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited
when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years
for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a
mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells
with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a
soul after a devil has claimed it.</p>
<h3 id="the-infernal-hierarchy">The Infernal Hierarchy</h3>
<p>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its
society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only
creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as
such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults
that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend
generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.</p>
<p>A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety,
Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his
enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends
and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine
Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the
Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and
he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as
he likes.</p>
<p>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of
sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning
to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in
the Nine Hells are destroyed forever-a fate that even Asmodeus
fears.</p>
<p><strong><em>Archdevils.</em></strong> The archdevils include all the
current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords
of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make
up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them.
Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its
particular evil nature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Greater Devils.</em></strong> The greater devils include
the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command
lesser devils and attend the archdevils.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lesser Devils.</em></strong> The lesser devils include
numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils,
bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lemures.</em></strong> The lowest form of devil, lemures
are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A
lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is
killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with
holy water before it can return to life.</p>
<p><strong><em>Promotion and Demotion.</em></strong> When the soul of an
evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of
a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to
promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils
to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to
archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful
transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form
to the next.</p>
<p>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit
fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its
command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as
when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed
into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom
promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal
forms.</p>
<p>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience
among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil
to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil
can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil
retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the
demotion is excessive.</p>
<p>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn
fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other's
most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he
can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever
infernal form he desires.</p>

<h4 id="the-nine-hells">The Nine Hells</h4>
<p>The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers
(see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight
layers are each ruled by archdevils that answer to the greatest
archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To
reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all
eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of
doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from
one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can
withstand the torment and horror of that journey.</p>

<h5 id="devil-true-names-and-talismans">Devil True Names and
Talismans</h5>
<p>Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in
station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced
to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are
said to exist that list the true names of certain devils.</p>
<p>A mortal who learns a devil's true name can use powerful summoning
magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service.
Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each
of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it
controls, and was bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice-typically
someone the creator loved-when crafted.</p>
<p>However it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane
typically resents being pressed into service. However, the devil seizes
every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner's soul
ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned,
and they easily commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they
still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them.</p>
