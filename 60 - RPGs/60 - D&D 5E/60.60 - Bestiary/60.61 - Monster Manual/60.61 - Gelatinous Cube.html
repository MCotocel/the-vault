<h2 id="gelatinous-cube">Gelatinous Cube</h2>
<p><em>Large ooze, unaligned</em> <strong><em> - <strong>Armor
Class</strong> 6 - <strong>Hit Points</strong> 84 (8d10 + 40) -

<strong>Senses</strong> blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius),
passive Perception 8 - <strong>Languages</strong> â€” -
<strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP) - <strong>Proficiency
Bonus</strong> +2 </em></strong> <strong><em>Ooze Cube.</em></strong>
The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the space,
but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's Engulf and has
disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the cube can be seen
but have total cover. A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an
action to pull a creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a
successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt
takes 10 (3d6) acid damage. The cube can hold only one Large creature or
up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Transparent.</em></strong> Even when the cube is in plain
sight, it takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a
cube that has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter
the cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Pseudopod.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4
to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (3d6) acid
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Engulf.</em></strong> The cube moves up to its speed.
While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces.
Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the creature must make a DC
12 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose
to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A creature that
chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving
throw. On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the
creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed
creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at
the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed
creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking
an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature
escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.</p>

<h2 id="gelatinous-cube-1">Gelatinous Cube</h2>
<p>Gelatinous cubes scour dungeon passages in silent, predictable
patterns, leaving perfectly clean paths in their wake. They consume
living tissue while leaving bones and other materials undissolved.</p>
<p>A gelatinous cube is all but transparent, making it hard to spot
until it attacks. A cube that is well fed can be easier to spot, since
its victims' bones, coins, and other objects can be seen suspended
inside the creature.</p>
<p><strong><em>Oozes.</em></strong> Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning
areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the
damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be
dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings,
spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through
cracks.</p>
<p>The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is
often the searing pain of its acidic touch. Oozes are drawn to movement
and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce
they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an
immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs
nearby.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slow Death.</em></strong> An ooze kills its prey slowly.
Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf
creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is
that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too
late.</p>
<p>Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have
coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their
quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its
killers.</p>
<p>Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few
beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of
intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or
self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating
without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of
sentience and malevolent intent.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unwitting Servants.</em></strong> Although an ooze lacks
the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that
understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it
can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend
passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a
pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from
coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers
in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel
or room.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spawn of Juiblex.</em></strong> According to the
Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments
or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ooze Nature.</em></strong> An ooze doesn't require
sleep.</p>
