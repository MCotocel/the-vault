Cone.</em></strong> The beholder's central eye creates an area of
antimagic, as in the <em>antimagic field</em> spell, in a 150-foot cone.
At the start of each of its turns, the beholder decides which way the
cone faces and whether the cone is active. The area works against the
beholder's own eye rays.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (4d6) piercing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eye Rays.</em></strong> The beholder shoots three of the
following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing one
to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it: - <strong>1. Charm
Ray</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving
throw or be charmed by the beholder for 1 hour, or until the beholder
harms the creature. - <strong>2. Paralyzing Ray</strong> The targeted
creature must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be
paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. -
<strong>3. Fear Ray</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC
16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. - <strong>4. Slowing Ray</strong> The
targeted creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the
creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a
bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. - <strong>5. Enervation Ray</strong> The targeted creature must
make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. -
<strong>6. Telekinetic Ray</strong> If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or the beholder moves it up to
30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic grip
until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder is
incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds or less
that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in any
direction. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this
ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a
container. - <strong>7. Sleep Ray</strong> The targeted creature must
succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain
unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or
another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on
constructs and undead. - <strong>8. Petrification Ray</strong> The
targeted creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must
repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the
effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the
<em>greater restoration</em> spell or other magic. - <strong>9.
Disintegration Ray</strong> If the target is a creature, it must succeed
on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If
this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a
pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical
object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a
saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of
magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it. -
<strong>10. Death Ray</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a
DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The
target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The beholder can take 3 legendary actions, using the Eye Ray option
below. It can take only one legendary action at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The beholder regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eye Ray.</strong> The beholder uses one random eye ray.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="beholder-1">Beholder</h2>
<p>One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul and
otherworldly nature. Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these aberrations
dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or
destroying them as they choose.</p>
<p>A beholder's spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great
bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks
that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a
beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes
open and alert.</p>
<p><strong><em>Xenophobic Isolationists.</em></strong> Enemies abound,
or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other
creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as
they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders
always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other
creatures are around.</p>
<p>The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other
beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any
deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind.
Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between
them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous
plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like
tentacles, while others' stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight
differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong
enemies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eye Tyrant.</em></strong> Some beholders manage to
channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. Rather
than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other
creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant
sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding
networks of agents that operate on their master's behalf.</p>
<p><strong><em>Alien Lairs.</em></strong> Because they refuse to share
territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills,
abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder's lair is carved
out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages
connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment
allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from
easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its
open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the
floor.</p>
<p>As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder's lair reflect the
creature's arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the
battles it has won, including petrified adventurers standing frozen in
their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic
items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges its own worth by its
acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Beholder's Lair.</em></strong> A beholder's central
lair is typically a large, spacious cavern with high ceilings, where it
can attack without fear of closing to melee range. A beholder
encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>When fighting inside its lair, a beholder can invoke the ambient
magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative
ties), the beholder can take one lair action to cause one of the
following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 50-foot-square area of ground within 120 feet of the beholder
becomes slimy; that area is difficult terrain until initiative count 20
on the next round.</li>
<li>Walls within 120 feet of the beholder sprout grasping appendages
until initiative count 20 on the round after next. Each creature of the
beholder's choice that starts its turn within 10 feet of such a wall
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Escaping
requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check.</li>
<li>An eye opens on a solid surface within 60 feet of the beholder. One
random eye ray of the beholder shoots from that eye at a target of the
beholder's choice that it can see. The eye then closes and
disappears.</li>
</ul>
<p>The beholder can't repeat an effect until they have all been used,
and it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.</p>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>A region containing a beholder's lair is warped by the creature's
unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creatures within 1 mile of the beholder's lair sometimes feel as if
they're being watched when they aren't.</li>
<li>When the beholder sleeps, minor warps in reality occur within 1 mile
of its lair and then vanish 24 hours later. Marks on cave walls might
change subtly, an eerie trinket might appear where none existed before,
harmless slime might coat a statue, and so on. These effects apply only
to natural surfaces and to nonmagical objects that aren't on anyone's
person.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the beholder dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10
days.</p>
