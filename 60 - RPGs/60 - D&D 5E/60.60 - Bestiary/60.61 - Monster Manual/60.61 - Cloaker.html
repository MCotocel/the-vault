<strong>Languages</strong> Deep Speech, Undercommon -
<strong>Challenge</strong> 8 (3,900 XP) - <strong>Proficiency
Bonus</strong> +3 </em></strong> <strong><em>Damage
Transfer.</em></strong> While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes
only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down). and that creature takes
the other half.</p>
<p><strong><em>False Appearance.</em></strong> While the cloaker remains
motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a
dark leather cloak.</p>
<p><strong><em>Light Sensitivity.</em></strong> While in bright light,
the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The cloaker makes two attacks:
one with its bite and one with its tail.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing
damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to
it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker
attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to
breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can
make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack
roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.
A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the
cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Moan.</em></strong> Each creature within 60 feet of the
cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed
on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the
cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the
creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).</em></strong> The cloaker magically creates three illusory
duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move
with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it
impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is
ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear. Whenever any
creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a
duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it
targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected
by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other
than sight. A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws.
If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw
against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="cloaker-1">Cloaker</h2>
<p>Cloakers earned their names for the resemblance they bear to dark
leathery cloaks. Lurking in remote dungeons and caves, these stealthy
predators wait to slay lone or injured prey stumbling through the
darkness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Camouflaged Lurkers.</em></strong> Like a stingray, a
cloaker's body is composed of cartilage and muscle. With its tail and
fins unfurled, it flies through darkness and lurks among the shadows of
caverns the same way a stingray glides through water and hides on the
ocean floor. Parallel rows of round, black eyespots run along its back
like buttons, and the ivory-colored claws on its cowl resemble bone
clasps.</p>
<p>When a cloaker unfurls and moves to attack, it reveals its pale
underside and makes its true nature evident. Red eyes glow above rows of
sharp teeth, and a long pendulous tail whips behind it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Opportunistic Predators.</em></strong> When hunting,
cloakers glide through the shadows at a safe distance behind groups of
other creatures traversing the Underdark. They follow parties of
humanoids to prey on the wounded after a battle, or pursue herds of
Underdark beasts, attacking the sick, the weak, or the straggling.</p>
<p>Cloakers strike quickly and consume their meals as swiftly as
possible, enveloping and devouring their victims. While it feeds, a
cloaker uses its swift, whiplike tail for defense, although it rarely
takes a stand against dangerous foes or groups of creatures. As an added
defense, cloakers can create illusory duplicates of themselves.</p>
<p><strong><em>Haunting Moan.</em></strong> Cloakers' thoughts are alien
to other life-forms, and they communicate with one another through
subsonic moans inaudible to most creatures. At higher intensities, a
cloaker's haunting moan becomes audible, evoking sensations of doom and
dread in creatures that hear it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cloaker Conclaves.</em></strong> Cloakers prefer
isolation, but they sometimes convene with other cloakers for defense or
to exchange information about new dangers, suitable hunting grounds, or
developments that might affect their habitats. When this convergence is
complete, the cloakers separate again.</p>
