<h2 id="orc-war-chief-1">Orc War Chief</h2>
<p>The war chief of an orc tribe is its strongest and most cunning
member. The reign of a war chief lasts only as long as it commands the
fear and respect of other tribe members, whose bloodlust must be
regularly satisfied lest the chief appear weak. Scions of Slaughter.
Gruumsh bestows special blessings upon war chiefs who prove themselves
in battle time and again, imbuing them with slivers of his savagery. A
war chief so blessed finds that his weapons cut deeper into his enemies,
allowing him to inflict more carnage.</p>
<p>King Obould Many-Arrows</p>
<p>King Obould of the Many-Arrows tribe is a legend among the orc war
chiefs of the Forgotten Realms, and he is the most famous orc chief in
the history of the D&amp;D game.</p>
<p>Smarter and more intuitive than most of his kind, Obould slew his
chieftain to take control of his tribe. Skilled in the arts of war and
renowned for his violent temper, Obould proved himself a fierce opponent
in battle time and again. Over the years, he subsumed other orc tribes
into his own, until he commanded a horde of thousands.</p>
<p>Obould leveraged his strength and influence to carve out a kingdom
for himself in the Spine of the World, a mountain range overlooking
numerous dwarven, human, and elven strongholds.</p>
<p>After years of bloody conflict with his more civilized neighbors,
Obould did the unthinkable and brokered a peace treaty with his enemies.
This treaty confused many of the orcs under Obould's command. It was
either a clever ploy by Obould to buy time while he strengthened his
army for a final, decisive sweep across the Savage Frontier, or it was a
troubling sign that Obould had forsaken the ways of Gruumsh and needed
to be destroyed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Orcs.</em></strong> Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers
with stooped postures, low foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent
lower canines that resemble tusks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gruumsh One-Eye.</em></strong> Orcs worship Gruumsh, the
mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in
ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their
followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been
taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been
settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been
claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a
furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the
mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the
fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and
destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs
wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p>
<p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon
Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's
eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering
elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine
might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his
honor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tribes like Plagues.</em></strong> Orcs gather in tribes
that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering
villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any
humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs
pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set
the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came,
their bloodlust satisfied.</p>
<p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides
into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party
returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack,
the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to
carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a
particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must
range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.</p>
<p>Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs
embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting
notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs,
and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and
power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ranging Scavengers.</em></strong> Their lust for
slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new
targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting
ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified
camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation
or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of
their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats
and trenches.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leadership and Might.</em></strong> Orc tribes are mostly
patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows,
Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites
scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod
over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of
overwhelming strength.</p>
<p><strong><em>Orc Crossbreeds.</em></strong> Luthic, the orc goddess of
fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and
indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation.
The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race,
and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates
with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or
a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an
orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of
intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.</p>
