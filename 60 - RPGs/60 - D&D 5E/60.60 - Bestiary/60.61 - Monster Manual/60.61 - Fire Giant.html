<h2 id="fire-giant-1">Fire Giant</h2>
<p>Master crafters and organized warriors, fire giants dwell among
volcanoes, lava floes, and rocky mountains. They are ruthless
militaristic brutes whose mastery of metalwork is legendary.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fire Forged.</em></strong> Fire giant fortresses are
built around and inside volcanoes or near magma-filled caverns. The
blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants' forges, and causes
the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. In lands
far removed from volcanic heat, fire giants mine coal to burn.
Traditional smithies occupy places of honor in their demesnes, and the
giants' stony fortresses constantly belch plumes of sooty smoke. In more
remote outposts, fire giants burn wood to keep their forge fires lit,
deforesting leagues of land in all directions.</p>
<p>Fire giants shun cold as much as their cousins the frost giants hate
heat. They can adapt to cold environments with effort, though, keeping
their hearth fires burning bright and wearing heavy woolen clothing and
furs to stay warm.</p>
<p><strong><em>Martial Experts.</em></strong> From birth, a fire giant
is taught to embrace a legacy of war. At the cradle, its parents chant
songs of battle. As children, fire giants play at war, hurling igneous
rocks at one another across the banks of magma rivers. In later years,
formal martial training becomes an integral part of life in the giants'
fortresses and underground realms of smoke and ash.</p>
<p>The fire giants' songs are odes of battles lost and won, while their
dances are martial formations of pounding feet that resound like smiths'
hammers throughout their smoky halls.</p>
<p>Just as fire giants pass down their knowledge of crafting from
generation to generation, their renowned fighting prowess comes not from
wild fury but from endless discipline and training. Enemies make the
mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their brutish manner,
learning too late that these giants live for combat and can be shrewd
tacticians.</p>
<p><strong><em>Feudal Lords.</em></strong> Humanoids conquered in war
become serfs to the fire giants. The serfs work the farms and fields on
the outskirts of fire giant halls and fortresses, raising livestock and
harvesting fields whose bounty is almost entirely tithed to the fire
giant kings.</p>
<p>Fire giant crafters work through insight and experience rather than
writing or arithmetic. Though most fire giants place little worth on
such frivolousness, they sometimes keep slaves at court who are versed
in such skills. Serfs not destined for court or the fields (especially
dwarves) are taken to the fire giants' mountainous realms to mine ore
and gemstones from deep within the earth.</p>
<p>Fire giants low in the ordning manage the mine tunnels and the slaves
that toil there, few of which survive the difficult and dangerous work
for long. Though fire giants are skilled in the engineering of mine
tunnels and the gathering of ore, they place less importance on the
safety of their slaves than on smelting and working the bounty those
slaves produce.</p>
<p><strong><em>Skilled Artisans.</em></strong> Fire giants have a
fearsome reputation as soldiers and conquerors, and for their ability to
burn, plunder, and destroy. Yet among the giants, fire giants produce
the greatest crafters and artists. They excel at smelting and smith
work, as they do at the engineering of metal and stone, and the quality
of their artistry shows even in their implements of destruction and
their weapons of war.</p>
<p>Fire giants strive to build the strongest fortresses and most potent
siege weapons. They experiment with alloys to create the hardest armor,
then forge the swords that can pierce it. Such work requires brawn and
brains in equal measure, and fire giants high in the ordning tend to be
the smartest and strongest of their kind.</p>
<h1 id="giants">Giants</h1>
<p>Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked
beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures
were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell
from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans
scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and
traditions of old.</p>
<h3 id="old-as-legend">Old as Legend</h3>
<p>In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths,
monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in
desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands,
now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.</p>
<p>Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the
giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they
spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational
wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what
started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn
are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval
wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one
another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area
without a fight.</p>
<h3 id="the-ordning">The Ordning</h3>
<p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and
storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and
culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent
animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p>
<p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on
social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to
each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows
which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants
are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of
skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in
these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p>
<p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also
ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning,
followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill
giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p>
<p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill
giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest
ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an
inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a
giant of another type, merely rude.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="giant-gods">Giant Gods</h5>
<p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants,
forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either
again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their
birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam
but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly
villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p>
<p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons
represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for
cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost
giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all
giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many
good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm
giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage
to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to
Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden;
Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and
arrogant trickster.</p>
<p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults,
paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other
non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain
to make a giant an outcast.</p>
