<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The shambling mound makes two
slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target
is grappled (escape DC 14), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on
it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to

<p><strong><em>Engulf.</em></strong> The shambling mound engulfs a
Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is
blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC
14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns
or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the
engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature
engulfed at a time.</p>

<h2 id="shambling-mound-1">Shambling Mound</h2>
<p>A shambling mound, sometimes called a shambler, trudges ponderously
through bleak swamps, dismal marshes, and rain forests, consuming any
organic matter in its path. This rotting heap of animated vegetation
looms up half again as tall as a human, tapering into a faceless "head"
at its top.</p>
<p><strong><em>All-Consuming Devourers.</em></strong> A shambling mound
feeds on any organic material, tirelessly consuming plants as it moves
and devouring animals that can't escape it. Only the shambling mounds'
rarity and plodding speed prevent them from overwhelming entire
ecosystems. Even so, their presence leeches natural environments of
plant and animal life, and an unsettling quiet pervades the swamps and
woods haunted by these ever-hungry horrors.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unseen Hunters.</em></strong> Composed of decaying
leaves, vines, roots, and other natural swamp and forest compost,
shamblers can blend into their environs. Because they move slowly, they
rarely attempt to pursue and catch creatures. Rather, they remain in
place, sustaining themselves by absorbing nutrients from their
surroundings as they wait for prey to come to them. When a creature
passes near or alights upon a shambling mound, the monster comes to
life, seizing and absorbing the unwary prey.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spawned by Lightning.</em></strong> A shambling mound
results from a phenomenon in which lightning or fey magic invigorates an
otherwise ordinary swamp plant. As the plant is reborn into its second
life, it chokes the life from plants and animals around it, mulching
their corpses in a heap around its roots. Those roots eventually give up
their reliance on the soil, directing the shambling mound to seek out
new sources of food.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Weed that Walks.</em></strong> The instinct that
drives a shambling mound is its central root-stem, buried somewhere
inside its ponderous form. The rest of a shambler consists of the
rotting heap that it simultaneously accumulates and feeds on, which
protects the root-stem and animates to smash and smother the life from
any creature.</p>
<p>The dense mass of a shambling mound's body shrugs off the effects of
cold and fire. Lightning reinvigorates the root-stem, strengthening the
shambling mound and bolstering its consumptive drive.</p>
<p>Despite its monstrous form, the shambling mound is a living plant
that requires air and nourishment. Although it doesn't sleep the way an
animal does, it can lie dormant for days on end before rising to hunt
for food.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Resurgent Menace.</em></strong> If a shambling mound
faces defeat before an overwhelming foe, the root-stem can feign death,
collapsing the remains of its mound. If not subsequently killed, the
root-stem beds down in the shambler's remains to slowly regrow its full
body, then once again sets out to consume all it can. In this way,
shambling mound infestations long thought destroyed can recur time and
again.</p>
