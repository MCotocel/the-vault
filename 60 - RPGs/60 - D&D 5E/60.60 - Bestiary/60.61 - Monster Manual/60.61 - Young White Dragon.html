<p><strong><em>Cold Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).</em></strong> The dragon
exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must
make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) cold damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="young-white-dragon-1">Young White Dragon</h2>
<p>The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the
chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic
areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by
hunger and greed.</p>
<p>A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest.
The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon
ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so
that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and
light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of
ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars
across a cloud-filled sky.</p>
<p><strong><em>Primal and Vengeful.</em></strong> White dragons lack the
cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature
makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on
surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only
food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath
weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in
ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a
good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.</p>
<p>A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as
trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The
remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned
prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.</p>
<p>Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary
memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to
conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them.
This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories
as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely
talk unless moved to do so.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lone Masters.</em></strong> White dragons avoid all other
dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons
seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to
conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.</p>
<p>White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a
white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such
creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures
that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that
demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put
up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This
includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their
lairs.</p>
<p>Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience
through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants
challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their
status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white
dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often
becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in
exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that
serve or oppose the giant.</p>
<p><strong><em>Treasure Under Ice.</em></strong> White dragons love the
cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities,
particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the
treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth
tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and
magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.</p>
<p>Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair,
glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and
chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's
breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's
great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser
creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the
dragon's main hoard.</p>
<p>A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to
possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates
each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously
difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult
to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize
the treasure on their own.</p>
<p><strong><em>A White Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> White dragons lair
in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor
high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces,
and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical
heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats
or slithering down icy crevasses.</p>
<p>A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area
around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's
presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the
keening wind in its lair changes tone.</p>
<p>A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the
floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden
pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the
dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing
breath.</p>
<h3 id="chromatic-dragons">Chromatic Dragons</h3>
<p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil
side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons
are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including
each other.</p>
<h4 id="driven-by-greed">Driven by Greed</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their
every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to
them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard
for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its
piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the
stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in
commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
<h4 id="creatures-of-ego">Creatures of Ego</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing
themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When
they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own
interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief
is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and
worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to
convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are
animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy
of respect.</p>
<h4 id="dangerous-lairs">Dangerous Lairs</h4>
<p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its
treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe
environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter
but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for
its hoard.</p>
<p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote
locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching
them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a
red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to
the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use
magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their
treasures.</p>
<h4 id="queen-of-evil-dragons">Queen of Evil Dragons</h4>
<p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She
dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god,
Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is
loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons,
believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers
and hers alone.</p>
<p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the
chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white.
She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies
with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her
fearsome claws.</p>
<p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom
she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special
enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus
and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>
