<strong><em>Earth Glide.</em></strong> The dao can burrow through
nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the dao doesn't
disturb the material it moves through.</p>
<p><strong><em>Elemental Demise.</em></strong> If the dao dies, its body
disintegrates into crystalline powder, leaving behind only equipment the
dao was wearing or carrying.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The dao's innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell
attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components:</p>
<p>At will: <em>detect evil and good</em>, <em>detect magic</em>,
<em>stone shape</em> 3/day each: <em>passwall</em>, <em>move earth</em>,
<em>tongues</em> 1/day each: <em>conjure elemental</em> (<strong>earth
elemental</strong> only), <em>gaseous form</em>, <em>invisibility</em>,
<em>phantasmal killer</em>, <em>plane shift</em>, <em>wall of
stone</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Sure-Footed.</em></strong> The dao has advantage on
Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would
knock it prone.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The Dao makes two fist attacks
or two maul attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fist.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Maul.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning
damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it must succeed on
a DC 18 Strength check or be knocked prone.</p>

<h2 id="dao-1">Dao</h2>
<p>Dao are greedy, malicious genies from the Elemental Plane of Earth.
They adorn themselves with jewelry crafted from precious gems and rare
metals, and when they fly, their lower bodies become columns of swirling
sand. A dao isn't happy unless it is the envy of other dao.</p>
<p><strong><em>All That Glitters.</em></strong> The dao dwell in
complexes of twisting tunnels and glittering ore-veined caverns on the
Elemental Plane of Earth. These maze works are continually expanding as
the dao delve into and reshape the rock around them. Dao care nothing
for the poverty or misfortune of others. A dao might grind powdered gems
and gold dust over its food to heighten the experience of eating,
devouring its wealth as mortals consume a precious spice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lords of the Earth.</em></strong> A dao never assists a
mortal unless the genie has something to gain, preferably treasure.
Among the genies, dao are on speaking and trading terms with the efreet,
but they have nothing but scorn for djinn and marids. Other races native
to the Elemental Plane of Earth avoid the dao, which are always seeking
new slaves to mine the maze works of their floating earth islands.</p>
<p><strong><em>Proud Slavers.</em></strong> The dao trade for the finest
slaves that money can buy, forcing them to work in dangerous
subterranean realms that rumble with earthquakes. As much as they enjoy
enslaving others, the dao hate being enslaved. Powerful wizards have
been known to lure dao to the Material Plane and trap them in the
confines of magic gemstones or iron flasks. Unfortunately for the dao,
their greed makes it relatively easy for mages to cozen them into
service.</p>
<p><strong><em>Genies.</em></strong> Genies are rare elemental creatures
out of story and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material Plane.
The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish
palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.</p>
<p>Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are
majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of
entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the
gods and other genies can challenge their power.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creatures of the Elements.</em></strong> A genie is born
when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial
matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an
elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a
genie.</p>
<p>A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form.
That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and
apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although
they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given
physical form. They don't mate with other genies or produce genie
offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion
of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection
to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although
such offspring are rare.</p>
<p>When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was
wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a
pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of
water and foam.</p>
<p>In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound
to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when
bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their
native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes.
For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into
service.</p>
<p>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies,
asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect
the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a
creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholden to any
noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie's
will and risk the consequences.</p>
<p>Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the
numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into
believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand
that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds-bow down
before them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rule or Be Ruled.</em></strong> Mortal slaves serve to
validate a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering
voices are music to a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves
prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view
slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to
nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their
slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil
genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent
that the slaves are no longer of use.</p>
<p><strong><em>Decadent Nobility.</em></strong> Noble genies are the
rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have
learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of
their desire. This constant indulgence has made them decadent, while
their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their
vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond
imagination.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Power of Worship.</em></strong> Genies acknowledge
the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship
them. They find the endless fawning and mewling of religious devotees
tiresome-except as it is directed toward them by their worshipful
slaves.</p>
