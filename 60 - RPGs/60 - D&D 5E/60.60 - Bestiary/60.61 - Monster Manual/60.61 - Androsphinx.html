17 (18,000 XP) - <strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong> +6 </em></strong>
<strong><em>Inscrutable.</em></strong> The sphinx is immune to any
effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as
any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to
ascertain the sphinx's intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Weapons.</em></strong> The sphinx's weapon attacks
are magical.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> The sphinx is a 12th-level
spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10
to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast
its spells. The sphinx has the following cleric spells prepared:</p>
<p>Cantrips (at will): <em>sacred flame</em>, <em>spare the dying</em>,
<em>thaumaturgy</em> 1st level (4 slots): <em>command</em>, <em>detect
evil and good</em>, <em>detect magic</em> 2nd level (3 slots):
<em>lesser restoration</em>, <em>zone of truth</em> 3rd level (3 slots):
<em>dispel magic</em>, <em>tongues</em> 4th level (3 slots):
<em>banishment</em>, <em>freedom of movement</em> 5th level (2 slots):
<em>flame strike</em>, <em>greater restoration</em> 6th level (1 slot):
<em>heroes' feast</em></p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The sphinx makes two claw
attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +12 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Roar (3/Day).</em></strong> The sphinx emits a magical
roar. Each time it roars before finishing a long rest, the roar is
louder and the effect is different, as detailed below. Each creature
within 500 feet of the sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a
saving throw. - <strong>First Roar</strong> Each creature that fails a
DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. - <strong>Second Roar</strong>
Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and
frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed and can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. - <strong>Third Roar</strong> Each
creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't
knocked prone.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The androsphinx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The androsphinx regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Claw Attack.</strong> The sphinx makes one claw attack.</li>
<li><strong>Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The sphinx magically
teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120
feet to an unoccupied space it can see.</li>
<li><strong>Cast a Spell (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> The sphinx casts a
spell from its list of prepared spells, using a spell slot as
normal.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="androsphinx-1">Androsphinx</h2>
<p>An androsphinx bears the head of a humanoid male on its lion's body.
Outwardly gruff and downcast, it often begins conversations with insults
or negative observations. Beneath this gruff exterior, however, an
androsphinx has a noble heart. It has no wish to lie or deceive, but it
doesn't give away information readily, choosing its words as wisely as
it guards its secrets.</p>
<p>An androsphinx tests the courage and valor of supplicants, not only
by forcing them to complete quests but also with its terrible roar,
which echoes for miles as it terrifies and deafens nearby creatures.
Those who pass its tests may be rewarded with a heroes' feast.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sphinxes.</em></strong> In sacred isolation, a sphinx
guards the secrets and treasures of the gods. As it calmly regards each
new party that comes before it, the bones of supplicants and quest
seekers that failed to pass its tests lie scattered around its lair. Its
great wings sweep along its flanks, its tawny leonine body rippling with
muscle and possessed of forepaws powerful enough to tear a humanoid in
half.</p>
<p><strong><em>Divine Guardians.</em></strong> Sphinxes test the worth
of those who seek the treasures of the gods, whether forgotten secrets
or mighty spells, artifacts or magical gateways. Creatures that choose
to face a sphinx's test are bound to that test unto death, and only
those worthy will survive it. The rest the sphinx destroys.</p>
<p>Some sphinxes are high priests of the gods that create them, but most
are simply embodied spirits, brought into the mortal realm by devout
prayer or direct intervention. A sphinx maintains its vigil tirelessly,
not needing to sleep or eat. It rarely engages with others of its kind,
knowing no other life except its sacred mission.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magical Tests.</em></strong> The secrets and treasures a
sphinx guards remain under divine protection, so that when a creature
fails a sphinx's test, the path to the object or knowledge it guards
vanishes. Even if a sphinx is attacked and defeated, a quester will
still fail to gain the secret it sought-and will make an enemy of the
god that placed the sphinx as a guardian.</p>
<p>Benign deities sometimes grant a sphinx the power to remove
supplicants that fail their tests, transporting them away and ensuring
that they never encounter the sphinx again. However, those who fail a
sphinx's test typically meet a gruesome end beneath its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Extraplanar Beings.</em></strong> Mortals that encounter
sphinxes do so most often in ancient tombs and ruins, but some sphinxes
can access extraplanar realms. A conversation with a sphinx that begins
between tumbled stone walls might suddenly shift to an alien locale,
such as a life-sized game board or a daunting cliff that must be climbed
in a howling storm. Sometimes a sphinx must be summoned from such an
extradimensional space, with supplicants calling it from its empty lair.
Only those the sphinx deems worthy gain admittance to its realm.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fallen Sphinxes.</em></strong> Whether through the
weariness of the ages, regret at the slaughter of innocents, or dreams
of worship by supplicants that attempt to bargain their way to
knowledge, some sphinxes break free of their divine command. However,
even if a sphinx's alignment and loyalties drift in this way, it never
leaves the place it guards or grants its secrets to any except creatures
it deems worthy.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Sphinx's Lair.</em></strong> A sphinx presides over an
ancient temple, sepulcher, or vault, within which are hidden divine
secrets and treasures beyond the reach of mortals.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sphinx can take
a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the sphinx
can't use an effect again until it finishes a short or long rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flow of time is altered such that every creature in the lair
must reroll initiative. The sphinx can choose not to reroll.</li>
<li>The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become 1d20 years
older or younger (the sphinx's choice), but never any younger than 1
year old. A <em>greater restoration</em> spell can restore a creature's
age to normal.</li>
<li>The flow of time within the lair is altered such that everything
within moves up to 10 years forward or backward (sphinx's choice). Only
the sphinx is immediately aware of the time change. A <em>wish</em>
spell can return the caster and up to seven other creatures designated
by the caster to their normal time.</li>
<li>The sphinx shifts itself and up to seven other creatures it can see
within in its lair to another plane of existence. Once outside its lair,
the sphinx can't use lair actions, but it can return to its lair as a
bonus action on its turn, taking up to seven creatures with it.</li>
</ul>
