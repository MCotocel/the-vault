<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The slaad makes three attacks:
one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +8 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +8 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing
damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease called chaos
phage. While infected, the target can't regain hit points, and its hit
point maximum is reduced by 10 (3d6) every 24 hours. If the disease
reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target instantly
transforms into a <strong>red slaad</strong> or, if it has the ability
to cast spells of 3rd level or higher, a <strong>green slaad</strong>.
Only a <em>wish</em> spell can reverse the transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="blue-slaad-1">Blue Slaad</h2>
<p>The bone hooks that protrude from the back of a blue slaad's hands
inflict a terrible transformative disease on humanoids wounded by them.
This infection, called chaos phage, transforms its victim into a fully
grown red slaadâ€”or green slaad if the host was a spellcaster able to
cast 3rd level spells or higher.</p>
<h1 id="slaadi">Slaadi</h1>
<p>In the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, bits of forest and meadow,
ruined castles, and isolated islands drift through a tumult of fire,
water, earth, and wind. The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable
plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no
formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat
of annihilation.</p>
<h3 id="the-spawning-stone">The Spawning Stone</h3>
<p>Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic,
geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast
it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the
chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the
stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds,
such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However,
Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy
absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as
slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the Spawning Stone
for this reason.</p>
<p>The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures
of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight.
Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn't perceive
the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="variant-slaad-control-gems">Variant: Slaad Control Gems</h5>
<p>As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically
implants a fragment of itself in the slaad's brain. This fragment takes
the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child's
fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use
magic to draw forth a slaad's gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The
slaad must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad's gem is
destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way.</p>
<p>A slaad born from something other than the Spawning Stone has no gem
in its brain, but it gains one if it ever comes into contact with the
Spawning Stone. Slaadi on Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so
most end up with a gem. A slaad with a control gem in its brain has the
following additional trait.</p>
<p><strong><em>Control Gem.</em></strong> Implanted in the slaad's brain
is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem
and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its
saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the
spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A
<em>wish</em> spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to
acquire the gem.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>greater restoration</em> spell cast on the slaad destroys the
gem without harming the slaad.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem
from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted
work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt
deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="birth-and-transformation">Birth and Transformation</h3>
<p>Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either
by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a
transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad
reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning
blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each
green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more
powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad
retains its memories.</p>
<h3 id="shapechangers">Shapechangers</h3>
<p>Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they
were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to
sow discord in the guise of their former selves.</p>
