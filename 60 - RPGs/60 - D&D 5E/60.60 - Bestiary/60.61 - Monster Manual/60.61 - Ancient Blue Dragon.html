<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its
Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +16 to
hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 20 (2d10 + 9) piercing
damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage.</p>

hit, reach 20 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the
dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it
must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to
the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).</em></strong> The dragon
exhales lightning in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature
in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (16d10)
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect.</strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon beats its
wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC
24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ancient-blue-dragon-1">Ancient Blue Dragon</h2>
<p>Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over
deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the
verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found
in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their
territories against all potential competitors, especially brass
dragons.</p>
<p>A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the
massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from
its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.</p>
<p>A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a
deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the
dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and
crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the
dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and
dusty air.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vain and Deadly.</em></strong> A blue dragon will not
stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking
great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser
creatures.</p>
<p>A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on
its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even
days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying
well out of harm's reach as it waits to attack again.</p>
<p><strong><em>Desert Predators.</em></strong> Though they sometimes eat
cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons
are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those
creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their
dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans
and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and
treasure to a dragon's eye.</p>
<p>When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that
only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an
outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand
pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Overlords and Minions.</em></strong> Blue dragons covet
valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of
superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become
valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service
handsomely.</p>
<p>A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its
most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs,
giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its
lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air
elementals and other creatures to serve them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hoarders of Gems.</em></strong> Though blue dragons
collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems.
Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they
covet sapphires, favoring jewelery and magic items adorned with those
gems.</p>
<p>A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand,
while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over
hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Blue Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> Blue dragons make
their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their
burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath
the sands.</p>
<p>Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon's lair, and narrow
tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding
the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon's first line of defense.</p>
<p>A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that
lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to
be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its
possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.</p>
<h3 id="chromatic-dragons">Chromatic Dragons</h3>
<p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil
side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons
are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including
each other.</p>
<h4 id="driven-by-greed">Driven by Greed</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their
every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to
them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard
for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its
piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the
stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in
commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
<h4 id="creatures-of-ego">Creatures of Ego</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing
themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When
they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own
interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief
is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and
worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to
convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are
animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy
of respect.</p>
<h4 id="dangerous-lairs">Dangerous Lairs</h4>
<p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its
treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe
environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter
but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for
its hoard.</p>
<p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote
locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching
them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a
red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to
the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use
magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their
treasures.</p>
<h4 id="queen-of-evil-dragons">Queen of Evil Dragons</h4>
<p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She
dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god,
Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is
loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons,
believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers
and hers alone.</p>
<p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the
chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white.
She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies
with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her
fearsome claws.</p>
<p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom
she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special
enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus
and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>

<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use
the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can
see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to
breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10
Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li>
<li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on
a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads
around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's
solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of
the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must
succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning
damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Additional Lair Actions.</em></strong> At your
discretion, a legendary (<strong>adult</strong> or
<strong>ancient</strong>) blue dragon can use one or both of the
following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Misleading Mirage</strong> Until initiative count 20 on the
next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a
creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a
different direction from the direction it intends.</li>
<li><strong>Sudden Sinkhole</strong> The dragon chooses a point on the
ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius,
20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground
above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On
a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (2d6)
bludgeoning damage and landing prone. On a successful save, a creature
moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the
pit.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the
dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</p></li>
<li><p>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust
devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a
speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1
(-5).</p></li>
<li><p>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole
can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom
(Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin
crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw or fall 1d6 Ã— 10 feet into the sinkhole.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the
thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they
are.</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional Regional Effects.</em></strong> Any of these
effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon's lair, in
addition to or instead of the effects described in the <em>Monster
Manual</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blue Luster</strong> Creatures that spend a year within 1
mile of the dragon's lair find blue objects fascinating and feel
compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Mirage Terrain</strong> The area immediately surrounding the
lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the
illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to
disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a
vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.</li>
<li><strong>Sandstorm</strong> A sandstorm blows constantly within 1
mile of the dragon's lair.</li>
</ul>
