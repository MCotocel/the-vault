</em></strong> <strong><em>Negative Energy Cone.</em></strong> The death
tyrant's central eye emits an invisible, magical 150-foot cone of
negative energy. At the start of each of its turns, the tyrant decides
which way the cone faces and whether the cone is active. Any creature in
that area can't regain hit points. Any humanoid that dies there becomes
a <strong>zombie</strong> under the tyrant's command. The dead humanoid
retains its place in the initiative order and animates at the start of
its next turn, provided that its body hasn't been completely
destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (4d6) piercing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eye Rays.</em></strong> The death tyrant shoots three of
the following magical eye rays at random (reroll duplicates), choosing
one to three targets it can see within 120 feet of it: - <strong>1.
Charm Ray</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw or be charmed by the death tyrant for 1 hour, or until the
death tyrant harms the creature. - <strong>2. Paralyzing Ray</strong>
The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw
or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- <strong>3. Fear Ray</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a
DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. - <strong>4. Slowing Ray</strong> The
targeted creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, the target's speed is halved for 1 minute. In addition, the
creature can't take reactions, and it can take either an action or a
bonus action on its turn, not both. The creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. - <strong>5. Enervation Ray</strong> The targeted creature must
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. -
<strong>6. Telekinetic Ray</strong> If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or the death tyrant moves it up
to 30 feet in any direction. It is restrained by the ray's telekinetic
grip until the start of the death tyrant's next turn or until the death
tyrant is incapacitated. If the target is an object weighing 300 pounds
or less that isn't being worn or carried, it is moved up to 30 feet in
any direction. The death tyrant can also exert fine control on objects
with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a door or a
container. - <strong>7. Sleep Ray</strong> The targeted creature must
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain
unconscious for 1 minute. The target awakens if it takes damage or
another creature takes an action to wake it. This ray has no effect on
constructs and undead. - <strong>8. Petrification Ray</strong> The
targeted creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must
repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the
effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the
<em>greater restoration</em> spell or other magic. - <strong>9.
Disintegration Ray</strong> If the target is a creature, it must succeed
on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (10d8) force damage. If
this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a
pile of fine gray dust. If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical
object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a
saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation of
magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it. -
<strong>10. Death Ray</strong> The targeted creature must succeed on a
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage. The
target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 hit points.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The death tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The death tyrant regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Eye Ray.</strong> The death tyrant uses one random eye
ray.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="death-tyrant-1">Death Tyrant</h2>
<p>On rare occasions, a beholder's sleeping mind drifts to places beyond
its normal madness, imagining a reality in which it exists beyond death.
When such dreams take hold, a beholder can transform, its flesh
sloughing away to leave a death tyrant behind. This monster possesses
the cunning and much of the magic it had in life, but it is fueled by
the power of undeath. A death tyrant appears as a massive, naked skull,
with a pinpoint of red light gleaming in its hollow eye socket. With its
eyestalks rotted away, ten spectral eyes hover above the creature and
glare in all directions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Deathly Despot.</em></strong> As they did when they were
beholders, death tyrants lord their power over other creatures.
Moreover, a beholder's ability to quash magical energy with its central
eye gives way to a more sinister power in a death tyrant, which can
transform former slaves and enemies into undead servants.</p>
<p>Zombies created by a death tyrant are used and discarded as needed.
They stand guard at the entrances to the death tyrant's lair or guard
its treasure vaults.</p>
<p>Acting as bait for traps or as combat fodder, zombies keep powerful
enemies distracted while the death tyrant moves into position and
prepares to destroy them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Armies of the Dead.</em></strong> A death tyrant that
embraces undeath becomes an engine of destruction. Driven by a hunger
for power and security, it advances against humanoid settlements, using
its eye rays to destroy every creature it encounters, then building an
army of undead. If left unchecked, a death tyrant might wipe out the
population of a city in weeks, then set its undead eye on wider
conquest. As each settlement falls, the death tyrant's zombie forces
build to overwhelming numbers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A death tyrant doesn't
require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Death Tyrant's Lair.</em></strong> A death tyrant's
lair is usually the same site it held as a beholder, but it contains
more trappings of death and decay. A death tyrant encountered in its
lair has a challenge rating of 15 (13,000 XP).</p>
<p>The death tyrant can't repeat an effect until all three have been
used, and it can't use the same effect on consecutive rounds.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>When fighting inside its lair, a death tyrant can invoke the ambient
magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative
ties), the death tyrant can take one lair action to cause one of the
following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>An area that is a 50-foot cube within 120 feet of the tyrant is
filled with spectral eyes and tentacles. To creatures other than the
death tyrant, that area is lightly obscured and difficult terrain until
initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
<li>Walls sprout spectral appendages until initiative count 20 on the
round after next. Any creature, including one on the Ethereal Plane,
that is hostile to the tyrant and starts its turn within 10 feet of a
wall must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled.
Escaping requires a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check.</li>
<li>A spectral eye opens in the air at a point within 50 feet of the
tyrant. One random eye ray of the tyrant shoots from that eye, which is
considered to be an ethereal source, at a target of the tyrant's choice.
The eye then closes and disappears.</li>
</ul>
<p>The death tyrant can't repeat an effect until all three have been
used, and it can't use the same effect on consecutive rounds.</p>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>A region containing a death tyrant's lair is warped by the creature's
unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creatures within 1 mile of the tyrant's lair sometimes feel as if
they're being watched even when they aren't.</li>
<li>When a creature hostile to the tyrant and aware of its existence
finishes a long rest within 1 mile of the tyrant's lair, roll a d20 for
that creature. On a roll of 10 or lower, the creature is subjected to
one random eye ray of the tyrant.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the death tyrant dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10
days.</p>
