</blockquote>
<h2 id="efreeti-1">Efreeti</h2>
<p>Hulking genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, the efreet are masters
of flame, immune to fire and able to create it on a whim. Fine silk
caftans and damask robes drape their magma-red or coal-black skin, and
they bedeck themselves in brass and gold torcs, chains, and rings, all
glittering with jewels. When an efreeti flies, its lower body transforms
into a column of smoke and embers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Haughty and Cruel.</em></strong> The efreet are
deceptive, cunning, and cruel to the point of ruthlessness. They despise
being forced into servitude and are relentless in pursuit of vengeance
against creatures that have wronged them. Efreet don't see themselves in
this light, naturally, and regard their race as fair and orderly, even
as they admit to an enlightened sense of self-interest.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spiteful Slavers.</em></strong> Efreet view all other
creatures as enemies or potential serfs. They raid the Material Plane
and the elemental planes for slaves, which they capture and bring back
to their homes on the Elemental Plane of Fire. The efreet rule as
oppressive tyrants, promoting only the cruelest among their slaves.
Those overseers are given whips to help keep the rank-and-file slaves in
line.</p>
<p><strong><em>Planar Raiders.</em></strong> Most efreet reside on the
Elemental Plane of Fire, either in great domed fortresses of black glass
and basalt surrounded by churning lakes of fire, or in the fabled City
of Brass. Additionally, efreet military outposts thronging with their
minions and slaves can be found scattered throughout the planes.</p>
<p>On the Material Plane, efreet dwell in fiery regions such as
volcanoes and the burning expanses of the world's deserts. Their love of
the desert brings them into conflict with the djinn that ride the desert
whirlwinds, and with the earthbound dao. Efreet utterly despise marids,
with whom they have maintained a passionate conflict throughout the
history of both races.</p>
<p><strong><em>Genies.</em></strong> Genies are rare elemental creatures
out of story and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material Plane.
The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish
palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.</p>
<p>Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are
majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of
entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the
gods and other genies can challenge their power.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creatures of the Elements.</em></strong> A genie is born
when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial
matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an
elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a
genie.</p>
<p>A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form.
That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and
apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although
they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given
physical form. They don't mate with other genies or produce genie
offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion
of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection
to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although
such offspring are rare.</p>
<p>When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was
wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a
pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of
water and foam.</p>
<p>In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound
to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when
bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their
native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes.
For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into
service.</p>
<p>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies,
asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect
the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a
creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholden to any
noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie's
will and risk the consequences.</p>
<p>Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the
numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into
believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand
that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds-bow down
before them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rule or Be Ruled.</em></strong> Mortal slaves serve to
validate a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering
voices are music to a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves
prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view
slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to
nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their
slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil
genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent
that the slaves are no longer of use.</p>
<p><strong><em>Decadent Nobility.</em></strong> Noble genies are the
rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have
learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of
their desire. This constant indulgence has made them decadent, while
their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their
vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond
imagination.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Power of Worship.</em></strong> Genies acknowledge
the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship
them. They find the endless fawning and mewling of religious devotees
tiresome-except as it is directed toward them by their worshipful
slaves.</p>
