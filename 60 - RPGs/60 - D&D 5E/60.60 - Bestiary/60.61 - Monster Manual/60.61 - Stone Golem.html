<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The golem makes two slam

<p><strong><em>Slow (Recharge 5â€“6).</em></strong> The golem targets one
or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make
a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a
target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more
than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an
action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1
minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>

<h2 id="stone-golem-1">Stone Golem</h2>
<p>Stone golems display great variety in shape and form, cut and
chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Though most
bear humanoid features, stone golems can be carved in any form the
sculptor can imagine. Ancient stone golems found in sealed tombs or
flanking the gates of lost cities sometimes take the forms of giant
beasts.</p>
<p>Like other golems, stone golems are nearly impervious to spells and
ordinary weapons. Creatures that fight a stone golem can feel the ebb
and flow of time slow down around them, almost as though they were made
of stone themselves.</p>
<p><strong><em>Golems.</em></strong> Golems are made from humble
materials-clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess
astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no
sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable
juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator's orders, and it protects or
attacks as that creator demands.</p>
<p>To create a golem, one requires a manual of golems (see the Dungeon
Master's Guide). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a
manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.</p>
<p><strong><em>Elemental Spirit in Material Form.</em></strong> The
construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring
great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or
surgery. Sometimes a golem's creator is the master of the art, but often
the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the
work.</p>
<p>After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the
golem's creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of
Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history.
It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit
to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's
creator.</p>
<p>A golem can be created with a special amulet or other item that
allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose
creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.</p>
<p>A golem can't think or act for itself. Though it understands its
commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that
understanding, and can't be reasoned with or tricked with words.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ageless Guardians.</em></strong> Golems can guard sacred
sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their
creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while
brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent
spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>Blind Obedience.</em></strong> When its creator or
possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the
golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to
follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can't fulfill
its orders, a golem might react violently-or stand and do nothing. A
golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates
between them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Constructed Nature.</em></strong> A golem doesn't require
air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
