<strong>Challenge</strong> 23 (50,000 XP) - <strong>Proficiency
Bonus</strong> +7 </em></strong> <strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong>
The kraken can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Freedom of Movement.</em></strong> The kraken ignores
difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause
it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from
nonmagical restraints or being grappled.</p>
<p><strong><em>Siege Monster.</em></strong> The kraken deals double
damage to objects and structures.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The kraken makes three
tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of
Fling.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +17 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing
damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the
kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While
swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover
against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42
(12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the
kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside
it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the
end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall
prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a
swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the
corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tentacle.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +17
to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 20 (3d6 + 10)
bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until
this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten
tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fling.</em></strong> One Large or smaller object held or
creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random
direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface,
the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was
thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must
succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be
knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning Storm.</em></strong> The kraken magically
creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the
kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23
Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The kraken regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tentacle Attack or Fling.</strong> The kraken makes one
tentacle attack or uses its Fling.</li>
<li><strong>Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The kraken uses
Lightning Storm.</li>
<li><strong>Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> While underwater, the
kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around
corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the
kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there
must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10)
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at
the end of the kraken's next turn.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="kraken-1">Kraken</h2>
<p>Beneath the waves, the kraken sleeps for untold ages, awaiting some
fell sign or calling. Land-born mortals who sail the open sea forget the
reasons their ancestors dreaded the ocean, even as the races of the deep
ignore strange gaps in their histories when their civilizations nearly
vanished after the appearance of the tentacled horror.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leviathans of Legend.</em></strong> At the beginning of
time, krakens served as fierce warriors of the gods. When the gods' wars
ended, the krakens shrugged free of their servitude, never again to be
bound by other beings. Whole nations quake in fear when the kraken
emerges from its dark demesne, and even in the middle of the deepest
oceans, storms rise or abate according to its will. The kraken is a
primeval force that obliterates the greatest achievements of
civilization as if they were castles in the sand. Its devastating
attacks can destroy ocean trade and halt communication between coastal
cities.</p>
<p>An ominous darkness presages a kraken's attack, and a cloud of inky
poison colors the water around it. Galleons and warships vanish when its
tentacles uncoil from the deep, the kraken breaking their masts like
kindling before drawing down ships and crew. Not even landlocked surface
dwellers are safe from a kraken's wrath. Krakens can breathe air as
easily as water, and some crawl up rivers to nest in freshwater lakes,
destroying cities and towns along the way. Adventurers tell of these
monsters lairing in the ruins of lakeside citadels, their tentacles
twined around leaning towers of disintegrating stone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mortal Foes.</em></strong> Some krakens are virtual gods,
with cults and minions spread across sea and land. Others are allied
with Olhydra, the evil Princess of Elemental Water, and use her cultists
to enforce their will on land and sea. A kraken pleased with its
worshipers can becalm rough seas and bring a bounteous harvest of fish
to the faithful. However, the devious mind of a kraken is ancient beyond
reckoning, and is ultimately bent to the ruination of all things.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Kraken's Lair.</em></strong> A kraken lives in dark
depths, usually a sunken rift or a cavern filled with detritus,
treasure, and wrecked ships.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the kraken takes a
lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strong current moves through the kraken's lair. Each creature
within 60 feet of the kraken must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving
throw or be pushed up to 60 feet away from the kraken. On a success, the
creature is pushed 10 feet away from the kraken.</li>
<li>Creatures in the water within 60 feet of the kraken have
vulnerability to lightning damage until initiative count 20 on the next
round.</li>
<li>The water in the kraken's lair becomes electrically charged. All
creatures within 120 feet of the kraken must succeed on a DC 23
Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) lightning damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a kraken's lair is warped by the creature's
blasphemous presence, creating the following magical effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The kraken can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered
on its lair. The effect is identical to the <em>control weather</em>
spell.</li>
<li>Water elementals coalesce within 6 miles of the lair. These
elementals can't leave the water and have Intelligence and Charisma
scores of 1 (-5).</li>
<li>Aquatic creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an
Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by the kraken and
aggressive toward intruders in the area.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the kraken dies, all of these regional effects fade
immediately.</p>
