<h2 id="owlbear-1">Owlbear</h2>
<p>An owlbear's screech echoes through dark valleys and benighted
forests, piercing the quiet night to announce the death of its prey.
Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the
limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish
head.</p>
<p><strong><em>Deadly Ferocity.</em></strong> The owlbear's reputation
for ferocity, aggression, stubbornness, and sheer ill temper makes it
one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if
anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an
owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature
cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without
provocation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Consummate Predators.</em></strong> An owlbear emerges
from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the
night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a
mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically
forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's
escape routes.</p>
<p>An owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of
its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing
portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees.
The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear's lair,
attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.</p>
<p>Owlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a
family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is required to
rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready
to hunt.</p>
<p><strong><em>Savage Companions.</em></strong> Although they are more
intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However,
with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an
owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a
fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even
succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which
owlbear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the
finish line first.</p>
<p>Elven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop
villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night.
Hobgoblins favor owlbears as war beasts, and hill giants and frost
giants sometimes keep owlbears as pets. A starved owlbear might show up
in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes
before a bloodthirsty audience.</p>
<p><strong><em>Owlbear Origins.</em></strong> Scholars have long debated
the origins of the owlbear. The most common theory is that a demented
wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear.
However, venerable elves claim to have known these creatures for
thousands of years, and some fey insist that owlbears have always
existed in the Feywild.</p>
