necrotic; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks -
<strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 13 -
<strong>Languages</strong> the languages it knew in life -
<strong>Challenge</strong> 5 (1,800 XP) - <strong>Proficiency
Bonus</strong> +3 </em></strong> <strong><em>Regeneration.</em></strong>
The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at
least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire
takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't
function at the start of the vampire's next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> The vampire can climb
difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing
to make an ability check.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vampire Weaknesses.</em></strong> The vampire has the
following flaws: <em>Forbiddance.</em> The vampire can't enter a
residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. <em>Harmed by
Running Water.</em> The vampire takes 20 acid damage when it ends its
turn in running water. <em>Stake to the Heart.</em> The vampire is
destroyed if a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into its heart
while it is incapacitated in its resting place. <em>Sunlight
Hypersensitivity.</em> The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it
starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The vampire makes two attacks,
only one of which can be a bite attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled
by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3)
piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and
the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts
until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect
reduces its hit point maximum to 0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing
damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target
(escape DC 13).</p>

<h2 id="vampire-spawn-1">Vampire Spawn</h2>
<p>Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have
lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires
abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or
reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living
keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dark Desires.</em></strong> Whether or not a vampire
retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments
wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into
hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of
emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a
vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might
become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and
potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items
such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Born from Death.</em></strong> Most of a vampire's
victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger
for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a
true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn
transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master's control. Few
vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire
spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Chained to the Grave.</em></strong> Every vampire remains
bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If
a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of
earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its
place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of
grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting
places this way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> Neither a vampire nor a
vampire spawn requires air.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Vampire's Lair.</em></strong> A vampire chooses a grand
yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor,
or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault
guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="player-characters-as-vampires">Player Characters as
Vampires</h5>
<p>The game statistics of a player character transformed into a vampire
spawn and then a vampire don't change, except that the character's
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren't
higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire's damage
resistances, darkvision, traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls
for the vampire's attacks are based on Strength.</p>
<p>The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the
vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's alignment becomes lawful
evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism
is reversed with a <em>wish</em> spell or the character is killed and
brought back to life.</p>

<blockquote>
<h5 id="strahd-von-zarovich">Strahd von Zarovich</h5>
<p>A brilliant thinker and capable warrior in life, Strahd von Zarovich
fought in countless battles for his people. When war and killing finally
stripped him of his youth and strength, he settled in the remote valley
of Barovia and built a castle on a towering pinnacle, from which he
could survey his lands. His brother Sergei came to live with him in
Castle Ravenloft, becoming Strahd's adviser and constant companion.</p>
<p>In his brother, Strahd saw everything he had lost. Sergei was
handsome and young, while Strahd had become old and scarred. Resentment
colored their relationship, eventually turning into hatred. Strahd's
beloved, Tatyana, spurned him for Sergei, whom she pledged to marry.</p>
<p>In a desperate attempt to win Tatyana's heart, Strahd forged a pact
with dark powers that made him immortal. At the wedding of Sergei and
Tatyana, he confronted his brother and killed him. Tatyana fled and
flung herself from Ravenloft's walls. Strahd's guards, seeing him for a
monster, shot him with arrows. But he did not die. He became a
vampire-the first vampire, according to many sages.</p>
<p>In the centuries since his transformation, Strahd's lust for life and
youth have only grown. He broods in his dark castle, cursing the living
for stealing away what he lost, and never admitting his hand in the
tragedy he created.</p>
