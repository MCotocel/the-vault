<h2 id="yuan-ti-abomination-1">Yuan-ti Abomination</h2>
<p>Monstrous serpents with burly humanoid torsos and arms, abominations
form the highest caste of yuan-ti society, and they most closely
resemble the race as the serpent gods intended it. They mastermind
elaborate schemes and perform dark rites in the hope of one day ruling
the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>Yuan-ti.</em></strong> Yuan-ti are devious serpent folk
devoid of compassion. From remote temples in jungles, swamps, and
deserts, the yuan-ti plot to supplant and dominate all other races and
to make themselves gods.</p>
<p><strong><em>Forsaken Humanity.</em></strong> The yuan-ti were once
humans who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and worshiped
serpents as totem animals. They lauded the serpent's sinuous
flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Their advanced
philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear,
focused thought.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their
warriors were legendary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples
stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in
prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods
heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness
as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew
more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of
the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and
humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes,
utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in
form, as well as in thought and emotion.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can't be bound for long
by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to serve. As a
result, yuan-ti first influence other creatures with the promise of
wealth and power. Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal
mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti that acts
honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a
grander design.</p>
<p>Yuan-ti leaders are cunning and ruthless tacticians who readily
sacrifice lesser yuan-ti if potential victory justifies such losses.
They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first in decisive
ambush if they can.</p>
<p><strong><em>Serpent Kings of Fallen Empires.</em></strong> The
yuan-ti view their physical transformation as a transcendent moment for
their race, allowing them to shed their frail humanity like dead skin.
Those that did not transform eventually became slaves or food for the
blessed of the serpent gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were
defeated by those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, and
the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great capitals, far
removed from other races.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cold of Heart.</em></strong> Humanoid emotions are
foreign to most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as
unexploitable weakness. A yuan-ti views the world and the events of its
own life with such extreme pragmatism that it is nearly impossible to
manipulate, influence, or control by nonmagical means, even as it seeks
to control other creatures through terror, pleasure, and awe.</p>
<p><strong><em>False Worship.</em></strong> Yuan-ti life revolves around
their temples, yet yuan-ti don't love the gods they worship. Instead,
they see worship as a means to attain power. A yuan-ti believes an
individual who attains enough power can devour and replace one of the
yuan-ti gods. The yuan-ti strive for ascension and are willing to commit
the darkest atrocities to achieve it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Serpent Gods.</em></strong> The yuan-ti revere a number
of powerful entities as gods, including the following.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dendar, the Night Serpent.</em></strong> Dendar's
followers say that one day she will grow so large from feasting on the
fears and nightmares of the world that she will devour it whole. Yuan-ti
that serve Dendar terrorize other creatures in any way they can, growing
and nurturing the fears of humanoids to feed the Night Serpent.</p>
<p><strong><em>Merrshaulk, Master of the Pit.</em></strong> Merrshaulk
is the long slumbering chief deity of the yuan-ti. As worship of
Merrshaulk waned, he went into slumber. Merrshaulk's priests are yuan-ti
abominations that maintain traditions of living sacrifice and cause
suffering in the god's name. With enough vile acts, the abominations
believe that Merrshaulk will reawaken and restore the yuan-ti to their
rightful place.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sseth, the Sibilant Death.</em></strong> Sseth appeared
to the yuan-ti of antiquity in the form of a winged yuan-ti claiming to
be an avatar of Merrshaulk. Speaking with Merrshaulk's voice, Sseth
vowed to pull the yuan-ti out of decline and build a new empire. Many of
Merrshaulk's devout turned to the worship of Sseth. Some yuan-ti have
long suspected Sseth as an usurper taking advantage of Merrshaulk's
slumber to make himself a god. They believe that Sseth might even have
devoured Merrshaulk, and now answers the prayers of Merrshaulk's
followers, as his priests convert or consume Merrshaulk's more stubborn
adherents.</p>
