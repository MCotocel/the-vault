</blockquote>
<h2 id="silver-dragon-wyrmling-1">Silver Dragon Wyrmling</h2>
<p>The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver
dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.</p>
<p>A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face
given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes.
A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip
of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver
highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually
brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver
dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of
mercury.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dragons of Virtue.</em></strong> Silver dragons believe
that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that
one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They
don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze
dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit
evil acts or harm the innocent.</p>
<p><strong><em>Friends of the Small Races.</em></strong> Silver dragons
enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships
outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver
dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form.
A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old
sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom
it develops strong friendships.</p>
<p>Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular
basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to
tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of
time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions
have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several
generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.</p>
<p><strong><em>Respect for Humanity.</em></strong> Silver dragons
befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans
spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't.
Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find
fascinating.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hoarding History.</em></strong> Silver dragons love to
possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of
coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well
as art objects and fine jewelery crafted by numerous races. Other
treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the
remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient
empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the
ruins of fallen cities.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Silver Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> Silver dragons
dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain
peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or
abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid
civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised
by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon
dreams of.</p>
<h3 id="metallic-dragons">Metallic Dragons</h3>
<p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as
one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the
world.</p>
<h4 id="noble-curiosity">Noble Curiosity</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but
they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather,
metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed
relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure
hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history,
and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other
creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even
evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's
hoard.</p>
<p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard
for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to
the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic
dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
<h4 id="solitary-shapeshifters">Solitary Shapeshifters</h4>
<p>At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical
ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon
learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures
for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their
lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city
streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and
amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
<p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as
possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are
often far out of touch with current events.</p>
<h4 id="the-persistence-of-memory">The Persistence of Memory</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of
humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons
can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person
they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with
over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a
cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart
as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might
resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the
dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
<h4 id="king-of-good-dragons">King of Good Dragons</h4>
<p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often
wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human
male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven
golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed
form.</p>
<p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though
he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon
Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes
worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a
lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>
