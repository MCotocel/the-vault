The dragon can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If the dragon
fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its
Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +12 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +12 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +12 to
hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the
dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it
must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to
the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5â€“6).</em></strong> The dragon
uses one of the following breath weapons. - <strong>Lightning
Breath</strong> The dragon exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5
feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. - <strong>Repulsion Breath</strong> The
dragon exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that
area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature is pushed 60 feet away from the dragon.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Shape.</em></strong> The dragon magically
polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no
higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true
form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or
borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon
retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak,
proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and
capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any
class features or legendary actions of that form.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect.</strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon beats its
wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC
20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adult-bronze-dragon-1">Adult Bronze Dragon</h2>
<p>Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic
plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe
other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and
eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.</p>
<p>A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's
head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its
lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet
and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling's scales are yellow tinged with
green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to
a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as
the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dragons of the Coast.</em></strong> Bronze dragons love
to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs,
sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those
ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip
aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for
treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters
with the ship's captain for the item.</p>
<p><strong><em>War Machines.</em></strong> Bronze dragons actively
oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by
putting their size and strength to good use. When a conflict unfolds
near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then
offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze
dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.</p>
<p><strong><em>Well-Organized Wealth.</em></strong> Bronze dragons loot
sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs
and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an
army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a
request is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection of
old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the
alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the
enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Bronze Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> A bronze dragon
lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it
within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest
for its eggs.</p>
<h3 id="metallic-dragons">Metallic Dragons</h3>
<p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as
one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the
world.</p>
<h4 id="noble-curiosity">Noble Curiosity</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but
they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather,
metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed
relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure
hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history,
and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other
creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even
evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's
hoard.</p>
<p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard
for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to
the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic
dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
<h4 id="solitary-shapeshifters">Solitary Shapeshifters</h4>
<p>At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical
ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon
learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures
for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their
lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city
streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and
amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
<p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as
possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are
often far out of touch with current events.</p>
<h4 id="the-persistence-of-memory">The Persistence of Memory</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of
humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons
can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person
they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with
over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a
cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart
as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might
resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the
dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
<h4 id="king-of-good-dragons">King of Good Dragons</h4>
<p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often
wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human
male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven
golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed
form.</p>
<p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though
he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon
Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes
worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a
lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>

<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the <em>fog cloud</em>
spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
<li>A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120
feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point
must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder
damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Additional Lair Actions.</em></strong> At your
discretion, a legendary (<strong>adult</strong> or
<strong>ancient</strong>) bronze dragon can use one or more of the
following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ocean's Call</strong> The dragon conjures a swarm of
spectral dolphins. Each creature in the water within 120 feet of the
dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10)
slashing damage; then the swarm vanishes.</li>
<li><strong>Salt Burst</strong> The dragon chooses a point it can see in
the lair. The air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point
bursts with abrasive salt crystals. Each creature in that area must
succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) slashing
damage.</li>
<li><strong>Whelming Water</strong> The dragon causes a strong current
to course through the water in its lair. The dragon chooses any number
of creatures it can see that are standing or swimming in water within
120 feet of it. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength
saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary bronze dragon's lair is warped by
the dragon's magic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius
centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise
the effect is identical to the <em>control weather</em> spell.</li>
<li>Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon's lair take on
dazzlingly brilliant hues.</li>
<li>Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft
music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of
the lair.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described
in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional Regional Effects.</em></strong> Any of these
effects might appear in the area around a bronze dragon's lair, in
addition to or instead of the effects described in the <em>Monster
Manual</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phantom Escort</strong> Ghostly naval ships from an ancient
armada appear, escorting well-meaning creatures in need of the dragon's
help toward the dragon's lair.</li>
<li><strong>Underwater Pursuit</strong> Sailors glimpse the shadowy,
illusory form of a dragon in the depths below them, keeping pace with
their vessel.</li>
<li><strong>Unfailing Faithfulness</strong> Sapient creatures that spend
a year within 10 miles of the dragon's lair find it nearly impossible to
break a promise.</li>
</ul>
