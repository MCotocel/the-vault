</blockquote>
<h2 id="githyanki-warrior-1">Githyanki Warrior</h2>
<p>The githyanki plunder countless worlds from the decks of their astral
vessels and the backs of red dragons. Feathers, beads, gems, and
precious metals decorate their armor and weapons-the legendary silver
swords with which they cut through their foes. Since winning their
freedom from the mind flayers, the githyanki have become ruthless
conquerors under the rulership of their dread lich-queen, Vlaakith.</p>
<p><strong><em>Astral Raiders.</em></strong> The githyanki despise all
other races, undertaking devastating raids that take them from their
strongholds in the Astral Plane to the far flung corners of the
multiverse. War is the ultimate expression of githyanki culture, and
their pitiless black eyes know no mercy. After a raid, they leave
shattered survivors enough food and resources to weakly endure. Later,
the githyanki return to their conquered foes, plundering them again and
again.</p>
<p><strong><em>Followers of Gith.</em></strong> In their own language,
githyanki means "followers of Gith." Under the guidance of Gith, the
githyanki stratified into a militaristic society, with a strict caste
system, dedicated to the ongoing fight against the victims and sworn
enemies of their race. When their leader Gith perished, she was replaced
by her undead adviser, Vlaakith. The lich-queen forbade worship of all
beings except herself.</p>
<p>Of all their enemies, the githyanki most hate their former masters,
the mind flayers. Their close kin, the githzerai, are second in their
enmity. All other creatures are treated with simple contempt by the
githyanki, whose xenophobic pride defines their view of inferior
races.</p>
<p><strong><em>Silver Swords.</em></strong> In ancient times, gith
knights created special weapons to combat their mind flayer masters.</p>
<p>These silver swords channel the force of the wielder's will, dealing
psychic as well as physical damage. A githyanki can't become a knight
until it masters the singular discipline needed to will such a blade
into existence. A silver sword is equivalent to a greatsword, and takes
on the properties of a +3 greatsword in the hands of its creator.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the githyanki, each silver sword is a priceless relic
and a work of art. Githyanki knights will hunt down and destroy any
non-githyanki that dares to carry or wield a silver sword, reclaiming it
for their people.</p>
<p><strong><em>Red Dragon Riders.</em></strong> In the uprising against
the illithids, Gith sought allies. Her adviser Vlaakith appealed to
Tiamat, the goddess of evil dragonkind, and Gith ventured into the Nine
Hells to meet with her. Only Tiamat now knows what passed between them,
but Vlaakith returned to the Astral Plane with the Dragon Queen's red
dragon consort Ephelomon, who proclaimed that his kind would forever act
as allies to the githyanki. Not all red dragons honor the alliance
kindled so long ago, but most at least don't consider the githyanki
their enemies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Outposts in the Mortal Realm.</em></strong> Since
creatures that dwell on the Astral Plane don't age, the githyanki
establish creches in remote areas of the Material Plane to raise their
young. Doubling as military academies, these creches train young
githyanki to harness their psychic and combat abilities. When a
githyanki grows to adulthood and slays a mind flayer as part of a sacred
rite of passage, it is permitted to rejoin its people on the Astral
Plane.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gith.</em></strong> The warlike githyanki and the
contemplative githzerai are a sundered people-two cultures that utterly
despise one another. Before there were githyanki or githzerai, these
creatures were a single race enslaved by the mind flayers. Although they
attempted to overthrow their masters many times, their rebellions were
repeatedly crushed until a great leader named Gith arose.</p>
<p>After much bloodshed, Gith and her followers threw off the yoke of
their illithid masters, but another leader named Zerthimon emerged in
the aftermath of battle.</p>
<p>Zerthimon challenged Gith's motives, claiming that her strict martial
leadership and desire for vengeance amounted to little more than another
form of slavery for her people. A rift erupted between followers of each
leader, and they eventually became the two races whose enmity endures to
this day.</p>
<p>Whether these tall, gaunt creatures were peaceful or savage, cultured
or primitive before the mind flayers enslaved and changed them, none can
say. Not even the original name of their race remains from that distant
time.</p>
