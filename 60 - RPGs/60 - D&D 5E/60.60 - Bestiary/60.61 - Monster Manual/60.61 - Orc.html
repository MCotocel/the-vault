<h2 id="orc-1">Orc</h2>
<p>Orcs are savage raiders and pillagers with stooped postures, low
foreheads, and piggish faces with prominent lower canines that resemble
tusks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gruumsh One-Eye.</em></strong> Orcs worship Gruumsh, the
mightiest of the orc deities and their creator. The orcs believe that in
ancient days, the gods gathered to divide the world among their
followers. When Gruumsh claimed the mountains, he learned they had been
taken by the dwarves. He laid claim to the forests, but those had been
settled by the elves. Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been
claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a
furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the
mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the
fields. Such was the role of the orcs, he proclaimed, to take and
destroy all that the other races would deny them. To this day, the orcs
wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.</p>
<p>Orcs hold a particular hatred for elves. The elven god Corellon
Larethian half-blinded Gruumsh with a well-placed arrow to the orc god's
eye. Since then, the orcs have taken particular joy in slaughtering
elves. Turning his injury into a baleful gift, Gruumsh grants divine
might to any champion who willingly plucks out one of its eyes in his
honor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tribes like Plagues.</em></strong> Orcs gather in tribes
that exert their dominance and satisfy their bloodlust by plundering
villages, devouring or driving off roaming herds, and slaying any
humanoids that stand against them. After savaging a settlement, orcs
pick it clean of wealth and items usable in their own lands. They set
the remains of villages and camps ablaze, then retreat whence they came,
their bloodlust satisfied.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ranging Scavengers.</em></strong> Their lust for
slaughter demands that orcs dwell always within striking distance of new
targets. As such, they seldom settle permanently, instead converting
ruins, cavern complexes, and defeated foes' villages into fortified
camps and strongholds. Orcs build only for defense, making no innovation
or improvement to their lairs beyond mounting the severed body parts of
their victims on spiked stockade walls or pikes jutting up from moats
and trenches.</p>
<p>When an existing territory is depleted of food, an orc tribe divides
into roving bands that scout for choice hunting grounds. When each party
returns, it brings back trophies and news of targets ripe for attack,
the richest of which is chosen. The tribe then sets out en masse to
carve a bloody path to its new territory.</p>
<p>On rare occasions, a tribe's leader chooses to hold onto a
particularly defensible lair for decades. The orcs of such a tribe must
range far across the countryside to sate their appetites.</p>
<p><strong><em>Leadership and Might.</em></strong> Orc tribes are mostly
patriarchal, flaunting such vivid or grotesque titles as Many-Arrows,
Screaming Eye, and Elf Ripper. Occasionally, a powerful war chief unites
scattered orc tribes into a single rampaging horde, which runs roughshod
over other orc tribes and humanoid settlements from a position of
overwhelming strength.</p>
<p>Strength and power are the greatest of orcish virtues, and orcs
embrace all manner of mighty creatures in their tribes. Rejecting
notions of racial purity, they proudly welcome ogres, trolls, half-orcs,
and orogs into their ranks. As well, orcs respect and fear the size and
power of evil giants, and often serve them as guards and soldiers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Orc Crossbreeds.</em></strong> Luthic, the orc goddess of
fertility and wife of Gruumsh, demands that orcs procreate often and
indiscriminately so that orc hordes swell generation after generation.
The orcs' drive to reproduce runs stronger than any other humanoid race,
and they readily crossbreed with other races. When an orc procreates
with a non-orc humanoid of similar size and stature (such as a human or
a dwarf), the resulting child is either an orc or a half-orc. When an
orc produces young with an ogre, the child is a half-ogre of
intimidating strength and brutish features called an ogrillon.</p>
