<p><em>Huge giant, chaotic evil</em> <strong><em> - <strong>Armor

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The fomorian attacks twice
with its greatclub or makes one greatclub attack and uses Evil Eye
once.</p>
<p><strong><em>Greatclub.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9
to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Evil Eye.</em></strong> The fomorian magically forces a
creature it can see within 60 feet of it to make a DC 14 Charisma saving
throw. The creature takes 27 (6d8) psychic damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong><em>Curse of the Evil Eye (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).</em></strong> With a stare, the fomorian uses Evil Eye, but on a
failed save, the creature is also cursed with magical deformities. While
deformed, the creature has its speed halved and has disadvantage on
ability checks, saving throws, and attacks based on Strength or
Dexterity. The transformed creature can repeat the saving throw whenever
it finishes a long rest, ending the effect on a success.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fomorian-1">Fomorian</h2>
<p>The most hideous and wicked of all giantkind are the godless
fomorians, whose deformed bodies reflect their vile demeanors. Some have
facial features randomly distributed around their misshapen, warty
heads. Others have limbs of grossly different sizes and shapes, or emit
terrible howls each time they draw breath through misshapen mouths.
Their wretched appearance rarely evokes sympathy, however, for the
fomorians brought their doom upon themselves with the evil that rules
their hearts and minds.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fey Curse.</em></strong> The elves remember when the
fomorians were among the most handsome of races, possessed of brilliant
minds and unrivaled magical ability. That physical perfection did not
extend to their hearts, however, as a lust for magic and power consumed
them. The fomorians sought to conquer the Feywild and enslave its
inhabitants, claiming those creatures' magic for themselves. When the
fey united to defend their realm, the fomorians fought them and were
subjected to a terrible curse.</p>
<p>One by one, the giants fell as their bodies were warped to reflect
the evil in their hearts. Stripped of their grace and magical power, the
wretched horrors fled from the light, delving deep beneath the world to
nurse their hatred. Cursing their fate, they have ever after plotted
vengeance against the fey that wronged them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Giants of the Underdark.</em></strong> The fomorians
dwell in eerily beautiful caverns in the Underdark, rarely venturing to
the surface. Their lairs feature abundant access to water, fish, and
mushroom forests, as well as to the creatures whose slave labor keeps
the fomorians fed. When those slaves can no longer toil, they are slain
and devoured. Wickedness and depravity are the cornerstones of fomorian
society, in which the strongest and cruelest giants rule. Fomorians mark
their territories with the corpses of their enemies, painting their
cavern walls with blood or stitching together limbs and body parts to
make mockeries of the creatures they have killed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ruined Flesh, Evil Minds.</em></strong> The deformities
visited on the fomorians prevent them from hurling rocks like their
giant kin, or wearing anything more than scraps of cloth. However, the
grotesque positioning of their eyes, noses, and ears gives fomorians
keen perceptive abilities, making it hard to surprise or ambush them.
The greed and evil of the fomorians lies at the heart of their
degeneration and fall, and continues to plague them. Fomorians make
alliances with other creatures when it suits them, but they are disloyal
by nature and betray their allies on a whim.</p>
<p><strong><em>Curse of the Evil Eye.</em></strong> Fomorians can pass
their curse onto others using a power called the evil eye-a last vestige
of the giants' once-remarkable spellcasting ability. A creature cursed
by a fomorian's evil eye is magically twisted and deformed, gaining a
glimpse into the pain and malice that has consumed this evil race.</p>
