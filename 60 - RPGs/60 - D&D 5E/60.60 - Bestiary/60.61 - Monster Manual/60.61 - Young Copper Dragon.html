<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon makes three
attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6).</em></strong> The dragon
uses one of the following breath weapons. - <strong>Acid Breath</strong>
The dragon exhales acid in a 40-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each
creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking
40 (9d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. - <strong>Slowing Breath</strong> The dragon exhales gas
in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use
reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack
on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute.
The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.</p>

<h2 id="young-copper-dragon-1">Young Copper Dragon</h2>
<p>Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and
riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite their gregarious
and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and
can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.</p>
<p>A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back
to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its
backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth,
a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the
dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a
green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the
eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Good Hosts.</em></strong> A copper dragon appreciates
wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes
annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its
tricks with good humor.</p>
<p>Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve
out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale
it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such
companionship is a treasure to be coveted.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cautious and Crafty.</em></strong> When building its
hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and
precious stones are favorites of these creatures.</p>
<p>A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions.
If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a
copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might
send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the
object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Copper Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> Copper dragons
dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in
narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the
dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has
collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open
caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the
real treasure is hidden.</p>
<h3 id="metallic-dragons">Metallic Dragons</h3>
<p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as
one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the
world.</p>
<h4 id="noble-curiosity">Noble Curiosity</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but
they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather,
metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed
relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure
hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history,
and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other
creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even
evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's
hoard.</p>
<p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard
for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to
the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic
dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
<h4 id="solitary-shapeshifters">Solitary Shapeshifters</h4>
<p>At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical
ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon
learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures
for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their
lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city
streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and
amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
<p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as
possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are
often far out of touch with current events.</p>
<h4 id="the-persistence-of-memory">The Persistence of Memory</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of
humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons
can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person
they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with
over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a
cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart
as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might
resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the
dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
<h4 id="king-of-good-dragons">King of Good Dragons</h4>
<p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often
wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human
male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven
golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed
form.</p>
<p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though
he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon
Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes
worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a
lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>
