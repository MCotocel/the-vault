<h2 id="young-gold-dragon-1">Young Gold Dragon</h2>
<p>The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons
are dedicated foes of evil.</p>
<p>A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that
resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing
twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings
start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it
fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A
gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks.
Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages,
its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p>
<p><strong><em>Devourer of Wealth.</em></strong> Gold dragons can eat
just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and
gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such
wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well
received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reserved Shapeshifters.</em></strong> Gold dragons are
respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness,
but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They
value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other
dragons except their own mates and offspring.</p>
<p>Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does
a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a
peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip,
patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In
the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a
wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or
weeks on end.</p>
<p><strong><em>Master Hoarders.</em></strong> A gold dragon keeps its
hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed
on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without
the dragon knowing about it.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Gold Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> Gold dragons make
their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please
without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and
rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling
waterfalls, or ancient ruins.</p>
<h3 id="metallic-dragons">Metallic Dragons</h3>
<p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as
one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the
world.</p>
<h4 id="noble-curiosity">Noble Curiosity</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but
they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather,
metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed
relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure
hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history,
and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other
creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even
evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's
hoard.</p>
<p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard
for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to
the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic
dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
<h4 id="solitary-shapeshifters">Solitary Shapeshifters</h4>
<p>At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical
ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon
learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures
for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their
lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city
streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and
amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
<p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as
possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are
often far out of touch with current events.</p>
<h4 id="the-persistence-of-memory">The Persistence of Memory</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of
humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons
can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person
they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with
over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a
cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart
as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might
resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the
dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
<h4 id="king-of-good-dragons">King of Good Dragons</h4>
<p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often
wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human
male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven
golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed
form.</p>
<p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though
he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon
Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes
worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a
lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>
