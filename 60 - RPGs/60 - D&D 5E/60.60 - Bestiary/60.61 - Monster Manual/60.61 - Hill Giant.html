<h2 id="hill-giant-1">Hill Giant</h2>
<p>Hill giants are selfish, dimwitted brutes that hunt, forage, and raid
in constant search of food. They blunder through hills and forests
devouring what they can, bullying smaller creatures into feeding them.
Their laziness and dullness would long ago have spelled their end if not
for their formidable size and strength.</p>
<p><strong><em>Primitive.</em></strong> Hill giants dwell in hills and
mountain valleys across the world, congregating in steadings built of
rough timber or in clusters of well-defended mud-and-wattle huts. Their
skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes
and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks
pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the reek of the
crude animal skins they wear, poorly stitched together with hair and
leather thongs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bigger Means Better.</em></strong> In a hill giant's
world, humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be hunted with
impunity. Creatures such as dragons and other giants are tough
adversaries. Hill giants equate size with power.</p>
<p>Hill giants don't realize they follow an ordning. They know only that
other giants are larger and stronger than they are, which means they are
to be obeyed. A hill giant tribe's chief is usually the tallest and
fattest giant that can still move about. Only on rare occasion does a
hill giant with more brains than bulk use its cunning to gain the favor
of giants of higher status, cleverly subverting the social order.</p>
<p><strong><em>Voracious Eaters.</em></strong> With nothing else to
occupy them, hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts
and forages alone or with a dire wolf companion, so as to not have to
share with other tribe members. The giant eats anything that isn't
obviously deadly, such as creatures known to be poisonous. Rotten meat
is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and even mud.</p>
<p>Farmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator such as an
ankheg might burrow through fields and consume a cow or two before being
driven off, a hill giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before
moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits,
vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand, the giant might
snack on them too.</p>
<p><strong><em>Stupid and Deadly.</em></strong> The hill giants' ability
to digest nearly anything has allowed them to survive for eons as
savages, eating and breeding in the hills like animals. They have never
needed to adapt and change, so their minds and emotions remain simple
and undeveloped.</p>
<p>With no culture of their own, hill giants ape the traditions of
creatures they manage to observe for a time before eating them. They
don't think about their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill
giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to topple entire
forests by trying to live in trees. Others attempting to take over
humanoid towns or villages get only as far as the doors and windows of a
building, taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter.</p>
<p>In conversation, hill giants are blunt and direct, and they have
little concept of deception. A hill giant might be fooled into running
from another giant if a number of villagers cover themselves in blankets
and stand on one another's shoulders holding a giant-painted pumpkin
head. Reasoning with a hill giant is futile, although clever creatures
can sometimes encourage a giant to take actions that benefit them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Raging Bullies.</em></strong> A hill giant that feels as
though it has been deceived, insulted, or made into a fool vents its
terrible wrath on anything it encounters. Even after smashing those who
offended it into pulp, the giant rampages until its rage abates, it
notices something more interesting, or it grows hungry.</p>
<p>If a hill giant proclaims itself king over a territory where other
humanoids live, it rules strictly by terror and tyranny. Its decisions
shift with its mood, and if it forgets the title it bestowed upon
itself, it might eat its subjects on a whim.</p>
<h1 id="giants">Giants</h1>
<p>Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked
beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures
were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell
from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans
scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and
traditions of old.</p>
<h3 id="old-as-legend">Old as Legend</h3>
<p>In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths,
monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in
desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands,
now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.</p>
<p>Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the
giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they
spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational
wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what
started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn
are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval
wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one
another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area
without a fight.</p>
<h3 id="the-ordning">The Ordning</h3>
<p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and
storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and
culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent
animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p>
<p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on
social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to
each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows
which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants
are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of
skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in
these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p>
<p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also
ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning,
followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill
giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p>
<p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill
giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest
ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an
inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a
giant of another type, merely rude.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="giant-gods">Giant Gods</h5>
<p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants,
forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either
again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their
birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam
but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly
villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p>
<p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons
represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for
cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost
giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all
giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many
good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm
giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage
to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to
Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden;
Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and
arrogant trickster.</p>
<p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults,
paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other
non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain
to make a giant an outcast.</p>
