<h2 id="green-hag">Green Hag</h2>
<p><em>Medium fey, neutral evil</em> <strong><em> - <strong>Armor
Class</strong> 17 (natural armor) - <strong>Hit Points</strong> 82 (11d8
+ 33) - <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft. </em></strong>
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA| |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| |18
(+4)|12 (+1)|16 (+3)|13 (+1)|14 (+2)|14 (+2)| <strong><em> -
<strong>Skills</strong> Arcana +3, Deception +4, Perception +4, Stealth

<strong>Languages</strong> Common, Draconic, Sylvan -
<strong>Challenge</strong> 3 (700 XP) or 5 (1,800 XP) when part of a
coven - <strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong> +2 </em></strong>
<strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The hag can breathe air and
water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The hag's innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately
cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>
<p>At will: <em>dancing lights</em>, <em>minor illusion</em>,
<em>vicious mockery</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Mimicry.</em></strong> The hag can mimic animal sounds
and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are
imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Illusory Appearance.</em></strong> The hag covers herself
and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that
makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid
shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if
she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but
someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature
must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC
20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is
disguised.</p>
<p><strong><em>Invisible Passage.</em></strong> The hag magically turns
invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration
ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no
physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic.
Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="green-hag-1">Green Hag</h2>
<p>The wretched and hateful green hags dwell in dying forests, lonely
swamps, and misty moors, making their homes in caves. Green hags love to
manipulate other creatures into doing their bidding, masking their
intentions behind layers of deception. They lure victims to them by
mimicking voices calling out for help, or drive unwanted visitors away
by imitating the cries of fierce beasts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Obsession with Tragedy.</em></strong> Green hags revel in
the failings and tragedies of other creatures. They derive joy from
bringing people low and seeing hope turn into despair, not just for
individuals but also for whole nations.</p>
<p><strong><em>Covens.</em></strong> A green hag that is part of a coven
(see the "Hag Covens" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 5 (1,800
XP).</p>
<h1 id="hags">Hags</h1>
<p>Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble
withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous
creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.</p>
<h3 id="faces-of-evil">Faces of Evil</h3>
<p>Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the
mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair,
horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny
fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch.
Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.</p>
<p>All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for
spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their
arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic
of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such
as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug,
Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.</p>
<h3 id="monstrous-motherhood">Monstrous Motherhood</h3>
<p>Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After
stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother's womb, the hag consumes
the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who
looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child
transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.</p>
<p>Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag
might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from
the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.</p>
<h3 id="dark-bargains">Dark Bargains</h3>
<p>Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning
of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is
open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper
respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much
knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are
pleased to sell.</p>
<p>Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a
bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains
typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something
dear-especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge
gained through the bargain.</p>
<h3 id="a-foul-nature">A Foul Nature</h3>
<p>Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and
accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They
nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating
flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help"
such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.</p>
<p>This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects
of a hag's life. A hag might fly in a magical giant's skull, landing it
on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might
travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and
disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen
their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their
victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.</p>
<h3 id="dark-sorority">Dark Sorority</h3>
<p>Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through
such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag
in existence. Hags don't like each other, but they abide by an ageless
code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into
another hag's territory, bring gifts when entering another hag's
dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags-as long as the oath
isn't given with the fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags' rules of
conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a
hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before
teaching it a permanent lesson.</p>
<h3 id="dark-lairs">Dark Lairs</h3>
<p>Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed
seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag's lair
reflects the creature's noxiousness, such that the land itself can
attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby,
while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off
creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and
conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary
wanderers.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="hag-covens">Hag Covens</h5>
<p>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are
equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire
more personal power.</p>
<p>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags
can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together,
as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually
chaos.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Shared Spellcasting.</em></strong> While all three
members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each
cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share
the spell slots among themselves:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1st level (4 slots): <em>identify</em>, <em>ray of
sickness</em></li>
<li>2nd level (3 slots): <em>hold person</em>, <em>locate
object</em></li>
<li>3rd level (3 slots): <em>bestow curse</em>, <em>counterspell</em>,
<em>lightning bolt</em></li>
<li>4th level (3 slots): <em>phantasmal killer</em>,
<em>polymorph</em></li>
<li>5th level (2 slots): <em>contact other plane</em>,
<em>scrying</em></li>
<li>6th level (1 slot): <em>eyebite</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that
uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 +
the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the
hag's Intelligence modifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Hag Eye.</em></strong> A hag coven can craft a magic item
called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and
often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually
entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven
can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the
same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven
member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new
one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The
ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During
the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the
ritual, they must start over.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful
aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties
usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any
lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the
save DC of the hag's most powerful ability.</p>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a
lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the
same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass
through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces
weren't there.</li>
<li>The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see,
causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can
be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to
force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses
this lair action again to open them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful green hag might have the following additional lair
action:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in
its own space. As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it
a distance equal to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak
on her turn (no action required). The illusion has the same statistics
as the hag but can't take actions or reactions. It can interact with its
environment and even pick up and hold real objects. The illusion seems
real in every way but disappears if it takes any amount of damage.
Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses it (no action required) or
can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair action to create a new
duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects in its
possession.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the
home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the
lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders.
Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses
the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end
immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10
days to fade away.</p>
<p>The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the
creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures
appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.</li>
<li>Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by
the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.</li>
<li>Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically
appear in trees.</li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful green hag creates one or more of the following additional
regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:</p>
<ul>
<li>Illusory duplicates of the hag appear in random places at random
times (but never more than one in any given location). An illusory
duplicate has no substance, but it looks, sounds, and moves like the
hag. The hag can sense when one or more creatures are within 60 feet of
her duplicate and can interact with them as if she were present and
standing in the duplicate's space. If the illusory duplicate takes any
damage, it disappears.</li>
<li>The region takes twice as long as normal to traverse, since the
plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are thick with reeking
mud.</li>
<li>Trees transform into awakened trees and attack when hostile
intruders are near.</li>
</ul>
