choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The dracolich has
advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dracolich can use its
Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +13 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing
damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +13 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +13 to
hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the
dracolich's choice that is within 120 feet of the dracolich and aware of
it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the dracolich's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6).</em></strong> The
dracolich exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each
creature in that line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking
66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The dracolich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The dracolich regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect.</strong> The dracolich makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> The dracolich makes a tail
attack.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dracolich beats
its tattered wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dracolich must
succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7)
bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. After beating its wings this
way, the dracolich can fly up to half its flying speed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="adult-blue-dracolich-1">Adult Blue Dracolich</h2>
<p>Even as long-lived as they are, all dragons must eventually die. This
thought doesn't sit well with many dragons, some of which allow
themselves to be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient rituals
into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the most narcissistic dragons
choose this path, knowing that by doing so, they sever all ties to their
kin and the dragon gods.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beyond Death.</em></strong> A dracolich retains its shape
and size upon transforming, its skin and scales drawing tight to its
bones or sloughing away to leave a skeletal form behind. Its eyes appear
as glowing points of light floating in shadowy sockets, hinting at the
malevolence of its undead mind.</p>
<p>Though many dragons pursue vain goals of destruction and dominance,
dracoliches are more nefarious than the most evil dragons, driven to
rule over all. A dracolich is a fiendishly intelligent tyrant that
crafts complex webs of foul schemes, attracting servants motivated by
greed and a lust for power. Acting from the shadows and actively
plotting to keep its existence a secret, a dracolich is a cunning and
challenging foe.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dracolich Phylacteries.</em></strong> Creating a
dracolich requires the cooperation of the dragon and a group of mages or
cultists that can perform the proper ritual. During the ritual, the
dragon consumes a toxic brew that slays it instantly. The attendant
spellcasters then ensnare its spirit and transfer it to a special
gemstone that functions like a lich's phylactery. As the dragon's flesh
rots away, the spirit inside the gem returns to animate the dragon's
bones.</p>
<p>If a dracolich's physical form is ever destroyed, its spirit returns
to the gem as long as the two are on the same plane. If the gem comes
into contact with another dragon's corpse, the dracolich's spirit can
take possession of that corpse to become a new dracolich. If the
dracolich's spirit gem is taken to another plane, the dracolich's spirit
has nowhere to go when its undead body is destroyed and simply passes
into the afterlife.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dracolich Template.</em></strong> Only an ancient or
adult true dragon can be transformed into a dracolich. Younger dragons
that attempt to undergo the transformation die, as do other creatures
that aren't true dragons but possess the dragon type, such as
pseudodragons and wyverns. A shadow dragon can't be transformed into a
dracolich, for it has already lost too much of its physical form.</p>
<p>When a dragon becomes a dracolich, it retains its statistics except
as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that
assumes a living physiology. The dracolich might retain or lose any or
all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Type.</em></strong> The dracolich's type changes from
dragon to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or
sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>Damage Resistance.</em></strong> The dracolich has
resistance to necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Damage Immunities.</em></strong> The dracolich has
immunity to poison. It also retains any immunities it had prior to
becoming a dracolich.</p>
<p><strong><em>Condition Immunities.</em></strong> The dracolich can't
be charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. It also doesn't suffer
from exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The dracolich has
advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use
the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can
see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to
breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10
Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li>
<li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on
a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads
around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.</li>
<li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair's
solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of
the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must
succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning
damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Additional Lair Actions.</em></strong> At your
discretion, a legendary (<strong>adult</strong> or
<strong>ancient</strong>) blue dragon can use one or both of the
following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Misleading Mirage</strong> Until initiative count 20 on the
next round, at each intersection or branching passage in the lair, a
creature other than the dragon has a 50 percent chance of going in a
different direction from the direction it intends.</li>
<li><strong>Sudden Sinkhole</strong> The dragon chooses a point on the
ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A 5-foot-radius,
20-foot-deep pit forms centered on that point. A creature on the ground
above where the pit formed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On
a failed save, a creature falls to the bottom of the pit, taking 7 (2d6)
bludgeoning damage and landing prone. On a successful save, a creature
moves to the nearest unoccupied space instead of falling in the
pit.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary blue dragon's lair is warped by the
dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
<li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil
has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can't fly, has a speed of
50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (-5).</li>
<li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon's lair. A sinkhole
can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom
(Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin
crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the
thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they
are.</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional Regional Effects.</em></strong> Any of these
effects might appear in the area around a blue dragon's lair, in
addition to or instead of the effects described in the <em>Monster
Manual</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blue Luster</strong> Creatures that spend a year within 1
mile of the dragon's lair find blue objects fascinating and feel
compelled to acquire them at every opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Mirage Terrain</strong> The area immediately surrounding the
lair appears to be a lush oasis. A creature carefully examining the
illusion can attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to
disbelieve it. A creature who disbelieves the illusion sees it as a
vague image superimposed on the underlying terrain.</li>
<li><strong>Sandstorm</strong> A sandstorm blows constantly within 1
mile of the dragon's lair.</li>
</ul>
