<h2 id="bullywug-1">Bullywug</h2>
<p>Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-headed
amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy
forests, marshes, and damp caves. Always hungry and thoroughly evil,
bullywugs overwhelm opponents with superior numbers when they can, but
they flee from serious threats to search for easier prey.</p>
<p>Bullywugs have green, gray, or mottled yellow skin that shifts
through shades of gray, green, and brown, allowing them to blend in with
their surroundings. They wear crude armor and wield simple weapons, and
can deliver a powerful bite to foes that press too close.</p>
<p><strong><em>Foul Aristocracy.</em></strong> Bullywugs consider
themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an
etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject
to the whims and fancies of their leader-a self-styled lord of the muck.
Bullywugs introduce themselves with grand-sounding titles, make great
shows of bowing and debasing themselves before their superiors, and
endlessly vie to win their superiors' favor.</p>
<p>A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either
murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds
secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as
tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders
its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common
for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the
goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their
good graces. Invariably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters
through abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord
invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as
tribute.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unruly Diplomacy.</em></strong> Bullywugs love nothing
more than lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their
warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying
them.</p>
<p>Captives are dragged before the king or queen-a bullywug of unusually
large size-and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery
can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not
before it tries to impress its "guests" with the majesty of its treasure
and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords
fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and
respect of outsiders.</p>
<p><strong><em>Amphibian Allies.</em></strong> Bullywugs speak a
language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking
like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within
minutes across this crude communication system.</p>
<p>Simple concepts in the language are understandable to frogs and
toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant
frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are
sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability to swallow
creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of
carrying prey back to their villages.</p>
