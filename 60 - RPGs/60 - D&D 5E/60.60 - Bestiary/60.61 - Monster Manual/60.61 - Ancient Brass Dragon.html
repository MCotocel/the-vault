<strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If the dragon
fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its
Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to
hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to
hit, reach 20 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the
dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it
must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to
the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6).</em></strong> The dragon
uses one of the following breath weapons: - <strong>Fire Breath</strong>
The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each
creature in that line must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking
56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. - <strong>Sleep Breath</strong> The dragon exhales sleep
gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC
21 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This
effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses
an action to wake it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Shape.</em></strong> The dragon magically
polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no
higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true
form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or
borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon
retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak,
proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and
capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any
class features or legendary actions of that form.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect.</strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon beats its
wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC
22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ancient-brass-dragon-1">Ancient Brass Dragon</h2>
<p>The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave
conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that
expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A
frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down
the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull,
mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine,
eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are
mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon
grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal
orbs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Boldly Talkative.</em></strong> A brass dragon engages in
conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life,
accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of
treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon's
presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the
creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond
with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature.
When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant
claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for
small talk is slaked.</p>
<p>A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy
conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is
being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind,
treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.</p>
<p><strong><em>Prized Treasures.</em></strong> Brass dragons covet magic
items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An
intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside
it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.</p>
<p>Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret
places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering
where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps.
Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest
hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried
desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Brass Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> A brass dragon's
desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling
holes to allow for sunlight.</p>
<h3 id="metallic-dragons">Metallic Dragons</h3>
<p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as
one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the
world.</p>
<h4 id="noble-curiosity">Noble Curiosity</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but
they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather,
metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed
relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure
hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history,
and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other
creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even
evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's
hoard.</p>
<p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard
for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to
the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic
dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
<h4 id="solitary-shapeshifters">Solitary Shapeshifters</h4>
<p>At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical
ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon
learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures
for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their
lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city
streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and
amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
<p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as
possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are
often far out of touch with current events.</p>
<h4 id="the-persistence-of-memory">The Persistence of Memory</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of
humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons
can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person
they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with
over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a
cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart
as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might
resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the
dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
<h4 id="king-of-good-dragons">King of Good Dragons</h4>
<p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often
wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human
male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven
golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed
form.</p>
<p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though
he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon
Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes
worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a
lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>

<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strong wind blows around the dragon. Each creature within 60 feet
of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed
15 feet away from the dragon and knocked prone. Gases and vapors are
dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished.
Protected flames; such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being
extinguished.</li>
<li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on
a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads
around corners. Each creature in it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Additional Lair Actions.</em></strong> At your
discretion, a legendary (<strong>adult</strong> or
<strong>ancient</strong>) brass dragon can use one or more of the
following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animate Statues</strong> The dragon chooses up to three
statues in the lair that it can see. Each of these statues briefly
animates and attacks one creature within 5 feet of it, with a +7 bonus
to hit and dealing 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage on a hit.</li>
<li><strong>Blast of Wind</strong> A mighty wind sweeps through the lair
in a direction of the dragon's choice, blowing along a line 40 feet wide
and 100 feet long. Each creature in that area except the dragon must
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the
wind's direction and be knocked prone. Gases and vapors are dispersed by
the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames,
such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished. If the
dragon is within the area of the wind, it can choose to be pushed 15
feet in the wind's direction, and the wind can't knock the dragon
prone.</li>
<li><strong>Obscuring Sand</strong> Dust and sand fill the air within
120 feet of the dragon, making the area <em>lightly obscured</em> until
initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary brass dragon's lair is warped by
the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracks appear in the sand within 6 miles of the dragon's lair. The
tracks lead to safe shelters and hidden water sources, while also
leading away from areas that the dragon prefers to remain
undisturbed.</li>
<li>Images of Large or smaller monsters haunt the desert sands within 1
mile of the dragon's lair. These illusions move and appear real,
although they can do no harm. A creature that examines an image from a
distance can tell it's an illusion with a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check. Any physical interaction with an image reveals it
to be an illusion, because objects pass through it.</li>
<li>Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher comes within
30 feet of a water source within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, the dragon
becomes aware of the creature's presence and location.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, the tracks fade in 1d10 days, but the other
effects fade immediately.</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional Regional Effects.</em></strong> Any of these
effects might appear in the area around a brass dragon's lair, in
addition to or instead of the effects described in the <em>Monster
Manual</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Companion</strong> A small, wispy cloud follows
non-evil creatures as they journey within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.
It changes direction as the creatures do, remaining interposed between
them and the direct glare of the sun, and grants them advantage on
saving throws to resist the effects of <em>extreme heat</em> (see the
<em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em>).</li>
<li><strong>Talkative Denizens</strong> Creatures within 1 mile of the
dragon's lair find pleasure in hearing the sound of their own voices.
The air is filled with a deafening chorus of birds and small animals,
and sapient creatures talk extensively.</li>
</ul>
