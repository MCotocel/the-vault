Bonus</strong> +6 </em></strong> <strong><em>Avoidance.</em></strong> If
the demilich is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving
throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it
succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If the
demilich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Turn Immunity.</em></strong> The demilich is immune to
effects that turn undead.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Howl (Recharge 5–6).</em></strong> The demilich emits a
bloodcurdling howl. Each creature within 30 feet of the demilich that
can hear the howl must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or
drop to 0 hit points. On a successful save, the creature is frightened
until the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Life Drain.</em></strong> The demilich targets up to
three creatures that it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must
succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (6d6) necrotic
damage, and the demilich regains hit points equal to the total damage
dealt to all targets.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The demilich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The demilich regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flight.</strong> The demilich flies up to half its flying
speed.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud of Dust.</strong> The demilich magically swirls its
dusty remains. Each creature within 10 feet of the demilich, including
around a corner, must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be
blinded until the end of the demilich's next turn. A creature that
succeeds on the saving throw is immune to this effect until the end of
the demilich's next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Drain (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> Each creature with
in 30 feet of the demilich must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature's hit point maximum is magically reduced
by 10 (3d6). If a creature's hit point maximum is reduced to 0 by this
effect, the creature dies. A creature's hit point maximum can be
restored with the <em>greater restoration</em> spell or similar
magic.</li>
<li><strong>Vile Curse (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> The demilich targets
one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically cursed. Until the curse
ends, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. The
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the curse on a success.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="demilich-1">Demilich</h2>
<p>The immortality granted to a lich lasts only as long as it feeds
mortal souls to its phylactery. If it falters or fails in that task, its
bones turn to dust until only its skull remains. This "demilich"
contains only a fragment of the lich's malevolent life force-just enough
so that if it is disturbed, these remains rise into the air and assume a
wraith-like form. The skull then emits a terrifying howl that can slay
the weak-hearted and leave others trembling with fear. Left alone, it
sinks back down and returns to the empty peace of its existence.</p>
<p>Few liches seek to become demiliches, for it means an end to the
existence they hoped to preserve by becoming undead. However, time can
erode the lich's reason and memory, causing it to retreat into its
ancient tomb and forget to feed on souls. The spells it once knew fade
from its mind, and it no longer channels the arcane energy it wielded as
a lich. However, even as a mere skull it remains a deadly and vexing
enemy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enduring Existence.</em></strong> Even after a lich is
reduced to a demilich state, its phylactery survives. As long as its
phylactery is intact, the demilich can't be permanently destroyed. Its
skull reforms after 1d10 days, restoring the creature to its wretched
state. If it has the presence of mind to do so, a demilich can reclaim
its former power by feeding just one soul to its phylactery. Doing so
restores the demilich to lich form, reconstituting its undead body.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A demilich doesn't require
air, food, drink, or sleep. So great is a demilich's will to survive
that it always has the maximum number of hit points for its Hit Dice,
instead of average hit points.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Demilich's Lair.</em></strong> A demilich hides its
earthly remains and treasures in a labyrinthine tomb guarded by monsters
and traps. At the heart of this labyrinth rests the demilich's skull and
the dust from its other bones. In its crypt, a demilich has access to
lair actions and additional uses for its legendary actions. Its whole
lair also has unique traits. A demilich in its lair has a challenge
rating of 20 (24,500 XP).</p>
<p><strong><em>Acererak and His Disciples.</em></strong> The
transformation into a demilich isn't a bitter end for all liches that
experience it. Made as a conscious choice, the path of the demilich
becomes the next step in a dark evolution. The lich Acererak-a powerful
wizard and demonologist and the infamous master of the Tomb of
Horrors-anticipated his own transformation, preparing for it by setting
enchanted gemstones into his skull's eye sockets and teeth. Each of
these soul gems possessed the power to capture the souls on which his
phylactery would feed.</p>
<p>Acererak abandoned his physical body, accepting that it would molder
and dissolve to dust while he traveled the planes as a disembodied
consciousness. If the skull that was his last physical remains was ever
disturbed, its gems would claim the souls of the insolent intruders to
his tomb, magically transferring them to his phylactery.</p>
<p>Liches who follow Acererak's path believe that by becoming free of
their bodies, they can continue their quest for power beyond the mortal
world. As their patron did, they secure their remains within
well-guarded vaults, using soul gems to maintain their phylacteries and
destroy the adventurers who disturb their lairs.</p>
<p>Acererak or another demilich like him has a challenge rating of 21
(33,000 XP), or 23 (50,000 XP) in its lair, and gains the following
additional action option.</p>
<p><strong><em>Trap Soul.</em></strong> The demilich targets one
creature that it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC
19 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target's soul is
magically trapped inside one of the demilich's gems. While the soul is
trapped, the target's body and all the equipment it is carrying cease to
exist. On a successful save, the target takes 24 (7d6) necrotic damage,
and if this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, its soul is
trapped as if it failed the saving throw. A soul trapped in a gem for 24
hours is devoured and ceases to exist.</p>
<p>If the demilich drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed and turns to
powder, leaving behind its gems. Crushing a gem releases any soul
trapped within, at which point the target's body re-forms in an
unoccupied space nearest to the gem and in the same state as when it was
trapped.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the demilich rolls a
d20. On a result of 11 or higher, the demilich takes a lair action to
cause one of the following effects. It can't use the same effect two
rounds in a row.</p>
<ul>
<li>The tomb trembles violently for a moment. Each creature on the floor
of the tomb must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked
prone.</li>
<li>The demilich targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it.
An <em>antimagic field</em> fills the space of the target, moving with
it until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
<li>The demilich targets any number of creatures it can see within 30
feet of it. No target can regain hit points until initiative count 20 on
the next round.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>A demilich's tomb might have any or all of the following effects in
place:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The first time a non-evil creature enters the tomb's area, the
creature takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage.</p></li>
<li><p>Monsters in the tomb have advantage on saving throws against
being charmed or frightened, and against features that turn
undead.</p></li>
<li><p>The tomb is warded against the magical travel of creatures the
demilich hasn't authorized. Such creatures can't teleport into or out of
the tomb's area or use planar travel to enter or leave it. Effects that
allow teleportation or planar travel work within the tomb as long as
they aren't used to leave or enter the tomb's area.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the demilich is destroyed, these effects fade over the course of
10 days.</p>
