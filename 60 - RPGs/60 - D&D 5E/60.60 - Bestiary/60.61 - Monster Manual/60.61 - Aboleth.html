The aboleth can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mucous Cloud.</em></strong> While underwater, the aboleth
is surrounded by transformative mucus. A creature that touches the
aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it
must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature
is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased creature can breathe only
underwater.</p>
<p><strong><em>Probing Telepathy.</em></strong> If a creature
communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth learns the
creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the creature.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The aboleth makes three
tentacle attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tentacle.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9
to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning
damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The disease has no effect
for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that cures disease. After 1
minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes translucent and slimy, the
creature can't regain hit points unless it is underwater, and the
disease can be removed only by <em>heal</em> or another disease-curing
spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is outside a body of
water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is
applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enslave (3/Day).</em></strong> The aboleth targets one
creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a
DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed by the aboleth until
the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from
the target. The charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't
take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate
telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the charmed
target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a
success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target
can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from
the aboleth.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The aboleth regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect.</strong> The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Swipe.</strong> The aboleth makes one tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> One creature
charmed by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and the aboleth
regains hit points equal to the damage the creature takes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aboleth-1">Aboleth</h2>
<p>Before the coming of the gods, aboleths lurked in primordial oceans
and underground lakes. They reached out with their minds and seized
control of the burgeoning life-forms of the mortal realm, making those
creatures their slaves. Their dominance made them like gods. Then the
true gods appeared, smashing the aboleths' empire and freeing their
slaves. Aboleths have never forgotten.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eternal Memories.</em></strong> Aboleths have flawless
memories. They pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to
generation. Thus, the injury of their defeat by the gods remains
perfectly preserved in their minds.</p>
<p>Aboleths' minds are treasure troves of ancient lore, recalling
moments from prehistory with perfect clarity. They plot patiently and
intricately across eons. Few creatures can conceive of the extent of an
aboleth's plan.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gods in the Lake.</em></strong> Aboleths dwell in watery
environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental
Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them,
aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from their
subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge
and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories. Aboleths use
their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their
desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty,
promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its
lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses,
granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised
rewards.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enemies of the Gods.</em></strong> The aboleths' fall
from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for
aboleths never truly die. If an aboleth's body is destroyed, its spirit
returns to the Elemental Plane of Water, where a new body coalesces for
it over days or months.</p>
<p>Ultimately, aboleths dream of overthrowing the gods and regaining
control of the world. Aboleths have had untold eons to plot and to
prepare their plans for perfect execution.</p>
<p><strong><em>An Aboleth's Lair.</em></strong> Aboleths lair in
subterranean lakes or the rocky depths of the ocean, often surrounded by
the ruins of an ancient, fallen aboleth city. An aboleth spends most of
its existence underwater, surfacing occasionally to treat with visitors
or deranged worshipers.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>When fighting inside its lair, an aboleth can invoke the ambient
magic to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative
ties), the aboleth takes a lair action to cause one of the following
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The aboleth casts <em>phantasmal force</em> (no components required)
on any number of creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. While
maintaining concentration on this effect, the aboleth can't take other
lair actions. If a target succeeds on the saving throw or if the effect
ends for it, the target is immune to the aboleth's phantasmal force lair
action for the next 24 hours, although such a creature can choose to be
affected.</li>
<li>Pools of water within 90 feet of the aboleth surge outward in a
grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool
must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet
into the water and knocked prone. The aboleth can't use this lair action
again until it has used a different one.</li>
<li>Water in the aboleth's lair magically becomes a conduit for the
creature's rage. The aboleth can target any number of creatures it can
see in such water within 90 feet of it. A target must succeed on a DC 14
Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (2d6) psychic damage. The aboleth can't
use this lair action again until it has used a different one.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by the creature's
presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Underground surfaces within 1 mile of the aboleth's lair are slimy
and wet and are difficult terrain.</li>
<li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled.
Enemies of the aboleth that drink such water vomit it within
minutes.</li>
<li>As an action, the aboleth can create an illusory image of itself
within 1 mile of the lair. The copy can appear at any location the
aboleth has seen before or in any location a creature charmed by the
aboleth can currently see. Once created, the image lasts for as long as
the aboleth maintains concentration, as if concentrating on a spell.
Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and can move like
the aboleth. The aboleth can sense, speak, and use telepathy from the
image's position as if present at that position. If the image takes any
damage, it disappears.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the aboleth dies, the first two effects fade over the course of
3d10 days.</p>
