is Charisma. The nycaloth can innately cast the following spells,
requiring no material components:</p>
<p>At will: <em>darkness</em>, <em>detect magic</em>, <em>dispel
magic</em>, <em>invisibility</em> (self only), <em>mirror image</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The nycaloth has
advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Weapons.</em></strong> The nycaloth's weapon
attacks are magical.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The nycaloth makes two melee
attacks, or it makes one melee attack and teleports before or after the
attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing
damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16
Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) slashing damage at the start
of each of its turns due to a fiendish wound. Each time the nycaloth
hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound
increases by 5 (2d4). Any creature can take an action to stanch the
wound with a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also
closes if the target receives magical healing.</p>

unoccupied space it can see.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="nycaloth-1">Nycaloth</h2>
<p>The elite airborne shock troops of the yugoloths, nycaloths look like
muscular gargoyles. Powerful bat wings bear them swiftly aloft in
battle, and the razorsharp claws of their hands and feet cut through
flesh and bone with ease. A nightmarish foe, a nycaloth strikes hard and
fast without warning, then teleports away. It uses its innate magic to
turn invisible or create illusory doubles of itself, further confounding
its enemies.</p>
<p>Nycaloths are the most loyal of the yugoloths. When they find an evil
master that treats them well, they are unlikely to break their agreement
unless the reward for doing so is extreme.</p>
<p>Yugoloths are fickle fiends that inhabit the planes of Acheron,
Gehenna, Hades, and Carceri. They act as mercenaries and are notorious
for their shifting loyalties. They are the embodiments of avarice.
Before serving under anyone's banner, a yugoloth asks the only question
on its mind: What's in it for me?</p>
<p><strong><em>Spawn of Gehenna.</em></strong> The first yugoloths were
created by a sisterhood of night hags on Gehenna. It is widely believed
that Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, commissioned the work, in the
hope of creating an army of fiends that were not bound to the Nine
Hells. In the course of making this new army, the hags crafted four
magic tomes and recorded the true names of every yugoloth they created,
save one, the General of Gehenna. These tomes were called the Books of
Keeping. Since knowing a fiend's true name grants power over it, the
hags used the books to ensure the yugoloths' loyalty. They also used the
books to capture the true names of other fiends that crossed them. It is
rumored that the Books of Keeping contain the true names of a few demon
lords and archdevils as well.</p>
<p>Petty jealousies and endless bickering caused the sisterhood to
dissolve, and in the ensuing power grab, the Books of Keeping were lost
or stolen. No longer indentured to anyone, the yugoloths gained
independence, and they now offer their services to the highest
bidder.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fiendish Mercenaries.</em></strong> Summoned yugoloths
demand much for their time and loyalty. Whatever promises a yugoloth
makes are quickly broken when a better opportunity presents itself.
Unlike demons, yugoloths can be reasoned with, but unlike devils, they
are rarely true to their word.</p>
<p>Yugoloths can be found anywhere, but the high cost of maintaining a
yugoloth army's loyalty typically exceeds what any warlord on the
Material Plane can pay. Being self-serving creatures, yugoloths quarrel
among themselves constantly. A yugoloth army is more organized than a
ravening horde of demons, but far less orderly and regimented than a
legion of devils. Without a powerful leader to keep them in line,
yugoloths fight simply to indulge their violent predilections, and only
as long as it benefits them to do so.</p>
<p><strong><em>Back to Gehenna.</em></strong> When a yugoloth dies, it
dissolves into a pool of ichor and reforms at full strength on the Bleak
Eternity of Gehenna. Only on its native plane can a yugoloth be
destroyed permanently. A yugoloth knows this and acts accordingly. When
summoned to other planes, a yugoloth fights without concern for its own
well-being. On Gehenna, it is more apt to retreat or plead for mercy if
its demise seems imminent.</p>
<p>When a yugoloth is permanently destroyed, its name vanishes from
every Book of Keeping. If a yugoloth is re-created by way of an unholy
ritual requiring the expenditure of souls, its name reappears in the
books.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Books of Keeping.</em></strong> When all four copies
of the Books of Keeping disappeared, Asmodeus and the night hags lost
control of their yugoloth creations. Each Book of Keeping still exists,
drifting from plane to plane, where the brave and the foolish
occasionally stumble upon them. A yugoloth summoned using its true name,
as inscribed in the Books of Keeping, is forced to serve its summoner
obediently. The yugoloth hates being controlled in this manner and isn't
shy about making its displeasure known. Like a petulant child, it will
follow its instructions to the letter while looking for opportunities to
misinterpret them.</p>
<p><strong><em>The General of Gehenna.</em></strong> Somewhere in the
brimstone wastes of Gehenna, there roams an ultroloth so strong that
none contests his power: the General of Gehenna. Many yugoloths search
for this great general in the hope of serving with him. They believe
that service with the General of Gehenna grants power and prestige among
lower planar entities.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, no fiend finds the General unless the General
desires it. His personal name is unknown, and even the Books of Keeping
contain no mention of this powerful, thoroughly evil entity.</p>
