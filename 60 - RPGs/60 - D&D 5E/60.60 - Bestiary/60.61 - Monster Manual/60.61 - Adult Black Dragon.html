<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If the dragon
fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its
Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +11 to

<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the
dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it
must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to
the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Acid Breath (Recharge 5â€“6).</em></strong> The dragon
exhales acid in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in

acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect.</strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon beats its
wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC
19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="adult-black-dragon-1">Adult Black Dragon</h2>
<p>The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black
dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These
dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of
humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling
ruins where kingdoms once stood.</p>
<p>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's
face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored
near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon
ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though
eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal
appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its
tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds
to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p>
<p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages,
its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes
and blasted ruins that are its home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Brutal and Cruel.</em></strong> All chromatic dragons are
evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black
dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the
illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.</p>
<p>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick
and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining
foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to
save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to
claim mastery over it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Foes and Servants.</em></strong> Black dragons hate and
fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for
opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a
stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks
out new territory.</p>
<p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid
settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude
draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
<p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the
spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay
good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
<p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They
become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening
captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them
to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wealth of the Ancients.</em></strong> Black dragons hoard
the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms
to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon
outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current
civilizations for itself.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Black Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> Black dragons dwell
in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is
a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded,
providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can
ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous
victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by
crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair,
which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
<h3 id="chromatic-dragons">Chromatic Dragons</h3>
<p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil
side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons
are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including
each other.</p>
<h4 id="driven-by-greed">Driven by Greed</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their
every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to
them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard
for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its
piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the
stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in
commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
<h4 id="creatures-of-ego">Creatures of Ego</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing
themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When
they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own
interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief
is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and
worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to
convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are
animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy
of respect.</p>
<h4 id="dangerous-lairs">Dangerous Lairs</h4>
<p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its
treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe
environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter
but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for
its hoard.</p>
<p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote
locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching
them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a
red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to
the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use
magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their
treasures.</p>
<h4 id="queen-of-evil-dragons">Queen of Evil Dragons</h4>
<p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She
dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god,
Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is
loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons,
believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers
and hers alone.</p>
<p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the
chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white.
She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies
with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her
fearsome claws.</p>
<p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom
she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special
enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus
and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>

<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use
the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pools of water that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it surge
outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of
such a pool must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled
up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone.</li>
<li>A cloud of swarming insects fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered
on a point the dragon chooses within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads
around corners and remains until the dragon dismisses it as an action,
uses this lair action again, or dies. The cloud is lightly obscured. Any
creature in the cloud when it appears must make on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half
as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the
cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage.</li>
<li>Magical darkness spreads from a point the dragon chooses within 60
feet of it, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere until the dragon dismisses
it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies. The darkness
spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through
this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it. If any of the
effect's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd
level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Additional Lair Actions.</em></strong> At your
discretion, a legendary (<strong>adult</strong> or
<strong>ancient</strong>) black dragon can use one or more of the
following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Filth Burst</strong> The dragon chooses a point on the
ground it can see within 120 feet of it. A 20-foot-radius, 20-foot-high
cylinder of watery filth centered on that point erupts from the ground
until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature in the
cylinder when it appears or that ends its turn there must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cylinder is
<em>difficult terrain</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Grasping Muck</strong> Tendrils of roiling muck extend from
the dragon's lair to grasp up to three creatures of the dragon's choice
that it can see within the lair. A targeted creature must succeed on a
DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until initiative count 20
on the next round.</li>
<li><strong>Noxious Gas</strong> A bubble of swamp gas erupts in a
20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within its
lair. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary black dragon's lair is warped by
the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long as normal
to traverse, since the plants grow thick and twisted, and the swamps are
thick with reeking mud.</p></li>
<li><p>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally
fouled. Enemies of the dragon that drink such water regurgitate it
within minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Fog lightly obscures the land within 6 miles of the
lair.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, vegetation remains as it has grown, but other
effects fade over 1d10 days.</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional Regional Effects.</em></strong> Any of these
effects might appear in the area around a black dragon's lair, in
addition to or instead of the effects described in the <em>Monster
Manual</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ennui</strong> Creatures that spend a year within 10 miles
of the dragon's lair are filled with listless despair.</li>
<li><strong>Grating Spies</strong> Trilling, obnoxious birds, bugs, and
reptiles follow any Humanoid creatures unknown to the dragon within 6
miles of the lair, imposing disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
The dragon can suppress this effect at will.</li>
<li><strong>Rotting Domain</strong> Stinging bugs are aggressive and the
air is heavy with the odor of rot within 6 miles of the lair.</li>
</ul>
