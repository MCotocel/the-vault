<strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong> +7 </em></strong> <strong><em>Angelic
Weapons.</em></strong> The solar's weapon attacks are magical. When the
solar hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 6d8 radiant damage
(included in the attack).</p>
<p><strong><em>Divine Awareness.</em></strong> The solar knows if it
hears a lie.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The solar's
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 25). It can innately
cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>
<p>At will: <em>detect evil and good</em>, <em>invisibility</em> (self
only) 3/day each: <em>blade barrier</em>, <em>dispel evil and good</em>,
<em>resurrection</em> 1/day each: <em>commune</em>, <em>control
weather</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The solar has advantage
on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The solar makes two greatsword
attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Greatsword.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em>
+15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing
damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slaying Longbow.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon
Attack:</em> +13 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15
(2d8 + 6) piercing damage plus 27 (6d8) radiant damage. If the target is
a creature that has 100 hit points or fewer, it must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or die.</p>
<p><strong><em>Flying Sword.</em></strong> The solar releases its
greatsword to hover magically in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of
it. If the solar can see the sword, the solar can mentally command it as
a bonus action to fly up to 50 feet and either make one attack against a
target or return to the solar's hands. If the hovering sword is targeted
by any effect, the solar is considered to be holding it. The hovering
sword falls if the solar dies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Healing Touch (4/Day).</em></strong> The solar touches
another creature. The target magically regains 40 (8d8 + 4) hit points
and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or
deafness.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The solar can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The solar regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teleport.</strong> The solar magically teleports, along with
any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied
space it can see.</li>
<li><strong>Searing Burst (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The solar emits
magical, divine energy. Each creature of its choice in a 10-foot radius
must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage
plus 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.</li>
<li><strong>Blinding Gaze (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> The solar targets
one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see it,
the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be
blinded until magic such as the <em>lesser restoration</em> spell
removes the blindness.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solar-1">Solar</h2>
<p>An angel is a celestial agent sent forth into the planes to further
its god's agenda for weal or woe. Its sublime beauty and presence can
drive awestruck onlookers to their knees. Yet angels are destroyers too,
and their appearance portends doom as often as it signals hope.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shards of the Divine.</em></strong> Angels are formed
from the astral essence of benevolent gods and are thus divine beings of
great power and foresight.</p>
<p>Angels act out the will of their gods with tireless devotion. Even
chaotic good deities command lawful good angels, knowing that the
angels' dedication to order best allows them to fulfill divine commands.
An angel follows a single driving purpose, as decreed by its deity.
However, an angel is incapable of following commands that stray from the
path of law and good.</p>
<p>An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of
law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This
quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that
comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of
another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel
is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods
of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to
the most dire circumstances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fallen Angels.</em></strong> An angel's moral compass
grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing.
Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but
sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional
or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as
an outcast. Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection
to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their
banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by
seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other
fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the
first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel,
some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the
Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits. If they are
redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and
compassionate service.</p>
<p><strong><em>Immortal Nature.</em></strong> An angel doesn't require
food, drink, or sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solar.</em></strong> A solar is godlike in its glory and
power.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, the solar's sword flies into the fray on its own,
and a single arrow from a solar's bow can strike a target dead on
contact. So great is a solar's celestial might that even demon princes
shrink at its resonant commands.</p>
<p>It is said that only twenty-four solars exist. The few solars that
are known are stewards of specific deities. The others rest in a state
of contemplation, waiting for the time when their services are needed to
stave off some cosmic threat to the cause of good.</p>
