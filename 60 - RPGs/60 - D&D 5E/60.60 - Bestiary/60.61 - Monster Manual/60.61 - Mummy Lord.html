XP) when encountered in lair - <strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong> +5
</em></strong> <strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The mummy
lord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rejuvenation.</em></strong> A destroyed mummy lord gains
a new body in 24 hours if its heart is intact, regaining all its hit
points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of
the mummy lord's heart.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> The mummy lord is a
10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save
DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The mummy lord has the following
cleric spells prepared:</p>
<p>Cantrips (at will): <em>sacred flame</em>, <em>thaumaturgy</em> 1st
level (4 slots): <em>command</em>, <em>guiding bolt</em>, <em>shield of
faith</em> 2nd level (3 slots): <em>hold person</em>, <em>silence</em>,
<em>spiritual weapon</em> 3rd level (3 slots): <em>animate dead</em>,
<em>dispel magic</em> 4th level (3 slots): <em>divination</em>,
<em>guardian of faith</em> 5th level (2 slots): <em>contagion</em>,
<em>insect plague</em> 6th level (1 slot): <em>harm</em></p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The mummy can use its Dreadful
Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rotting Fist.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em>
+9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (3d6 + 4)
bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a
creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be
cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and
its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that
elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the
target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed
by the <em>remove curse</em> spell or other magic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dreadful Glare.</em></strong> The mummy lord targets one
creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the
mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this
magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If
the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for
the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune
to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24
hours.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The mummy lord can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The mummy lord regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attack.</strong> The mummy lord makes one attack with its
rotting fist or uses its Dreadful Glare.</li>
<li><strong>Blinding Dust.</strong> Blinding dust and sand swirls
magically around the mummy lord. Each creature within 5 feet of the
mummy lord must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be
blinded until the end of the creature's next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Blasphemous Word (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The mummy lord
utters a blasphemous word. Each non-undead creature within 10 feet of
the mummy lord that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC
16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the mummy
lord's next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Channel Negative Energy (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The
mummy lord magically unleashes negative energy. Creatures within 60 feet
of the mummy lord, including ones behind barriers and around corners,
can't regain hit points until the end of the mummy lord's next
turn.</li>
<li><strong>Whirlwind of Sand (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The mummy lord
magically transforms into a whirlwind of sand, moves up to 60 feet, and
reverts to its normal form. While in whirlwind form, the mummy lord is
immune to all damage, and it can't be grappled, petrified, knocked
prone, restrained, or stunned. Equipment worn or carried by the mummy
lord remain in its possession.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mummy-lord-1">Mummy Lord</h2>
<p>In the tombs of the ancients, tyrannical monarchs and the high
priests of dark gods lie in dreamless rest, waiting for the time when
they might reclaim their thrones and reforge their ancient empires. The
regalia of their terrible rule still adorns their linen-wrapped bodies,
their moldering robes stitched with evil symbols and bronze armor etched
with devices of dynasties that fell a thousand years before.</p>
<p>Under the direction of the most powerful priests, the ritual that
creates a mummy can be increased in potency. The mummy lord that rises
from such a ritual retains the memories and personality of its former
life, and is gifted with supernatural resilience. Dead emperors wield
the same infamous rune-marked blades that they did in legend. Sorcerer
lords work the forbidden magic that once controlled a terrified
populace, and the dark gods reward dead priest-kings' prayers by
imparting divine spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>Heart of the Mummy Lord.</em></strong> As part of the
ritual that creates a mummy lord, the creature's heart and viscera are
removed from the corpse and placed in canopic jars. These jars are
usually carved from limestone or made of pottery, etched or painted with
religious hieroglyphs.</p>
<p>As long as its shriveled heart remains intact, a mummy lord can't be
permanently destroyed. When it drops to 0 hit points, the mummy lord
turns to dust and re-forms at full strength 24 hours later, rising out
of dust in close proximity to the canopic jar containing its heart. A
mummy lord can be destroyed or prevented from re-forming by burning its
heart to ashes. For this reason, a mummy lord usually keeps its heart
and viscera in a hidden tomb or vault.</p>
<p>The mummy lord's heart has AC 5, 25 hit points, and immunity to all
damage except fire.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Mummy Lord's Lair.</em></strong> A mummy lord watches
over an ancient temple or tomb that is protected by lesser undead and
rigged with traps. Hidden in this temple is the sarcophagus where a
mummy lord keeps its greatest treasures. A mummy lord encountered in its
lair has a challenge rating of 16 (15,000 XP).</p>
<p><strong><em>Mummies.</em></strong> Raised by dark funerary rituals, a
mummy shambles from the shrouded stillness of a time-lost temple or
tomb. Having been awoken from its rest, it punishes transgressors with
the power of its unholy curse.</p>
<p><strong><em>Preserved Wrath.</em></strong> The long burial rituals
that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its body from rot. In
the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs are removed and
placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils,
herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is
typically wrapped in linen bandages.</p>
<p>More ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as revealing a secret the
mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can't be so
easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the
creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Will of Dark Gods.</em></strong> An undead mummy is
created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually
imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen
wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial
ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in
undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual.
Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or
former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Punished.</em></strong> Once deceased, an individual
has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies
were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or
who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment,
they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed
away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from
slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creature of Ritual.</em></strong> A mummy obeys the
conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it,
driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that
foreshadows a mummy's attack can leave the intended victim paralyzed
with fright. In the days following a mummy's touch, a victim's body rots
from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ending a Mummy's Curse.</em></strong> Rare magic can undo
or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly
die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by
undoing the transgression that caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be
replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb,
or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Archives.</em></strong> Though they seldom bother
to do so, mummies can speak. As a result, some serve as undead
repositories of lost lore, and can be consulted by the descendants of
those who created them. Powerful individuals sometimes intentionally
sequester mummies away for occasional consultation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A mummy doesn't require air,
food, drink, or sleep.</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the mummy lord takes
a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the mummy lord
can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each undead creature in the lair can pinpoint the location of
each living creature within 120 feet of it until initiative count 20 on
the next round.</p></li>
<li><p>Each undead in the lair has advantage on saving throws against
effects that turn undead until initiative count 20 on the next
round.</p></li>
<li><p>Until initiative count 20 on the next round, any non-undead
creature that tries to cast a spell of 4th level or lower in the mummy
lord's lair is wracked with pain. The creature can choose another
action, but if it tries to cast the spell, it must make a DC 16
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 necrotic
damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is
wasted.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>A mummy lord's temple or tomb is warped in any of the following ways
by the creature's dark presence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food instantly molders and water instantly evaporates when brought
into the lair. Other non magical drinks are spoiled - wine turning to
vinegar, for instance.</li>
<li><em>Divination</em> spells cast within the lair by creatures other
than the mummy lord have a 25 percent chance to provide misleading
results, as determined by the DM. If a <em>divination</em> spell already
has a chance to fail or become unreliable when cast multiple times, that
chance increases by 25 percent.</li>
<li>A creature that takes treasure from the lair is cursed until the
treasure is returned. The cursed target has disadvantage on all saving
throws. The curse lasts until removed by a <em>remove curse</em> spell
or other magic.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the mummy lord is destroyed, these regional effects end
immediately.</p>
