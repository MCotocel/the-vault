<h2 id="sea-hag">Sea Hag</h2>
<p><em>Medium fey, chaotic evil</em> <strong><em> - <strong>Armor
Class</strong> 14 (natural armor) - <strong>Hit Points</strong> 52 (7d8
+ 21) - <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., swim 40 ft. </em></strong>
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA| |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| |16
(+3)|13 (+1)|16 (+3)|12 (+1)|12 (+1)|13 (+1)| <strong><em> -
<strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11 -
<strong>Languages</strong> Aquan, Common, Giant -
<strong>Challenge</strong> 2 (450 XP) or 4 (1,100 XP) when part of a
coven - <strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong> +2 </em></strong>
<strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The hag can breathe air and
water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horrific Appearance.</em></strong> Any humanoid that
starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true
form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is
within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24
hours. Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's
true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the
initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that
averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Death Glare.</em></strong> The hag targets one frightened
creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the
hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic
or drop to 0 hit points.</p>
<p><strong><em>Illusory Appearance.</em></strong> The hag covers herself
and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that
makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid
shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if
she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but
someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature
must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC
16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is
disguised.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="sea-hag-1">Sea Hag</h2>
<p>Sea hags live in dismal and polluted underwater lairs, surrounded by
merrow and other aquatic monsters.</p>
<p>Beauty drives a sea hag to fits of anger. When confronted with
something beautiful, the hag might simply attack it or deface it. If
something beautiful gives hope, a sea hag wants it to cause despair. If
it inspires courage, the sea hag wants it to cause fear.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ugly Inside and Out.</em></strong> Sea hags are by far
the ugliest of all hags, with slimy scales covering their pallid skin. A
sea hag's hair resembles seaweed and covers her emaciated body, and her
glassy eyes seem as lifeless as a doll's. Although a sea hag can hide
her true form under a veil of illusion, the hag is cursed to forever
appear ugly. Her illusory form appears haggard at best.</p>
<p><strong><em>Covens.</em></strong> A sea hag that is part of a coven
(see the "Hag Covens" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 4 (1,100
XP).</p>
<h1 id="hags">Hags</h1>
<p>Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble
withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous
creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.</p>
<h3 id="faces-of-evil">Faces of Evil</h3>
<p>Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the
mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair,
horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny
fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch.
Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.</p>
<p>All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for
spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their
arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic
of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such
as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug,
Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.</p>
<h3 id="monstrous-motherhood">Monstrous Motherhood</h3>
<p>Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After
stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother's womb, the hag consumes
the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who
looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child
transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.</p>
<p>Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag
might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from
the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.</p>
<h3 id="dark-bargains">Dark Bargains</h3>
<p>Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning
of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is
open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper
respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much
knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are
pleased to sell.</p>
<p>Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a
bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains
typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something
dear-especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge
gained through the bargain.</p>
<h3 id="a-foul-nature">A Foul Nature</h3>
<p>Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and
accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They
nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating
flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help"
such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.</p>
<p>This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects
of a hag's life. A hag might fly in a magical giant's skull, landing it
on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might
travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and
disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen
their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their
victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.</p>
<h3 id="dark-sorority">Dark Sorority</h3>
<p>Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through
such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag
in existence. Hags don't like each other, but they abide by an ageless
code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into
another hag's territory, bring gifts when entering another hag's
dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags-as long as the oath
isn't given with the fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags' rules of
conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a
hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before
teaching it a permanent lesson.</p>
<h3 id="dark-lairs">Dark Lairs</h3>
<p>Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed
seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag's lair
reflects the creature's noxiousness, such that the land itself can
attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby,
while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off
creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and
conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary
wanderers.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="hag-covens">Hag Covens</h5>
<p>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are
equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire
more personal power.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags
can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together,
as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually
chaos.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shared Spellcasting.</em></strong> While all three
members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each
cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share
the spell slots among themselves:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1st level (4 slots): <em>identify</em>, <em>ray of
sickness</em></li>
<li>2nd level (3 slots): <em>hold person</em>, <em>locate
object</em></li>
<li>3rd level (3 slots): <em>bestow curse</em>, <em>counterspell</em>,
<em>lightning bolt</em></li>
<li>4th level (3 slots): <em>phantasmal killer</em>,
<em>polymorph</em></li>
<li>5th level (2 slots): <em>contact other plane</em>,
<em>scrying</em></li>
<li>6th level (1 slot): <em>eyebite</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that
uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 +
the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the
hag's Intelligence modifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Hag Eye.</em></strong> A hag coven can craft a magic item
called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and
often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually
entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven
can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the
same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven
member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new
one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The
ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During
the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the
ritual, they must start over.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful
aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties
usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any
lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the
save DC of the hag's most powerful ability.</p>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a
lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the
same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass
through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces
weren't there.</li>
<li>The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see,
causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can
be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to
force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses
this lair action again to open them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful sea hag might have the following additional lair
actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hag fills up to four 10-foot cubes of water with ink. The inky
areas are heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a steady, strong
underwater current disperses the ink on initiative count 10. The hag
ignores the obscuring effect of the ink.</li>
<li>The hag chooses one humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a
simulacrum of that creature (as if created with the <em>simulacrum</em>
spell). This hideous simulacrum is formed out of seaweed, slime,
half-eaten fish, and other garbage, but still generally resembles the
creature it is imitating. This simulacrum obeys the hag's commands and
is destroyed on initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the
home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the
lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders.
Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses
the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end
immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10
days to fade away.</p>
<p>The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the
creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other creatures
appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.</li>
<li>Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by
the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the area.</li>
<li>Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically
appear in trees.</li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful sea hag creates one or more of the following additional
regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most surfaces are covered by a thin film of slime, which is slick
and sticks to anything that touches it.</li>
<li>Currents and tides are exceptionally strong and treacherous. Any
ability check made to safely navigate or control a vessel moving through
these waters has disadvantage.</li>
<li>Shores are littered with dead, rotting fish. The hag can sense when
one of the fish is handled and cause it to speak with her voice.</li>
</ul>
