<h2 id="storm-giant-1">Storm Giant</h2>
<p>Storm giants are contemplative seers that live in places far removed
from mortal civilization. Most have pale purple-gray skin and hair, and
glittering emerald eyes.</p>
<p>Some rare storm giants are violet-skinned, with deep violet or
blue-black hair and silvery gray or purple eyes. They are benevolent and
wise unless angered, in response to which the fury of a storm giant can
affect the fate of thousands.</p>
<p><strong><em>Distant Prophet-Kings.</em></strong> Storm giants live in
isolated refuges so far above the surface of the world or below the sea
that they are beyond the reach of most other creatures. Some make their
abodes in cloud-top castles so high that flying dragons appear as specks
below. Others live atop mountain peaks that pierce the clouds. Some
occupy palaces covered with algae and coral at the bottom of the ocean,
or grim fortresses in undersea rifts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Detached Oracles.</em></strong> Storm giants recall the
glory of ancient giant empires forged by the god Annam. They seek to
restore what was lost when those empires fell. They don't compete for
status in the ordning but live out the centuries of their existence in
contemplative seclusion, watching the starry heavens and the ocean's
depths for signs, symbols, and omens of Annam's favor.</p>
<p>Storm giants see the events of the world in a wide perspective. They
can foretell the rise and fall of kings and empires, see the beginnings
and ends of fortune and disaster, and find the patterns within seemingly
unrelated events. By reading omens and prophesying, storm giants learn
of vast secrets previously unknown and troves of lore utterly
forgotten.</p>
<p>Kings will rise and fall, wars will be won and lost, and good and
evil will wrestle in conflict. Storm giants have watched these events in
the manner of mortal gods over many lifetimes, and they know it is
pointless to intervene. Even so, a storm giant might willingly disclose
certain secrets to benevolent beings that visit its remote domain with
specific purpose. Such creatures must speak and act respectfully,
however, for a storm giant roused to anger is a force of utter
destruction.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solitary Lives.</em></strong> Storm giants communicate
infrequently with others of their kind. They do so usually to compare
signs and omens or engage in a rare courtship. Storm giant parents stay
together to raise a child to maturity, then return to the solitary
isolation they cherish.</p>
<p>Some humanoid cultures worship storm giants as they would worship
lesser gods, creating myths and stories around the giants' exploits and
vast knowledge. A storm giant is governed by the dictates of its
conscience, however, and not by any culture's laws or codes of honor. As
such, a storm giant that bends its mind toward greed or gains a taste
for petty power can easily become a terrible threat.</p>
<h1 id="giants">Giants</h1>
<p>Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked
beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures
were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell
from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans
scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and
traditions of old.</p>
<h3 id="old-as-legend">Old as Legend</h3>
<p>In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths,
monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in
desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands,
now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.</p>
<p>Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the
giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they
spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational
wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what
started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn
are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval
wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one
another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area
without a fight.</p>
<h3 id="the-ordning">The Ordning</h3>
<p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and
storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and
culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent
animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p>
<p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on
social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to
each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows
which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants
are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of
skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in
these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p>
<p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also
ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning,
followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill
giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p>
<p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill
giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest
ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an
inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a
giant of another type, merely rude.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="giant-gods">Giant Gods</h5>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants,
forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either
again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their
birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam
but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly
villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p>
<p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons
represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for
cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost
giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all
giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many
good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm
giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage
to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to
Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden;
Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and
arrogant trickster.</p>
<p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults,
paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other
non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain
to make a giant an outcast.</p>
