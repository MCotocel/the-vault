<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The mummy can use its Dreadful
Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rotting Fist.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em>
+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3)
bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a
creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be
cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and
its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that
elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the
target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed
by the <em>remove curse</em> spell or other magic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dreadful Glare.</em></strong> The mummy targets one
creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the
mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic
or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the
target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the
same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to
the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24
hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mummy-1">Mummy</h2>
<p>Raised by dark funerary rituals, a mummy shambles from the shrouded
stillness of a time-lost temple or tomb. Having been awoken from its
rest, it punishes transgressors with the power of its unholy curse.</p>
<p><strong><em>Preserved Wrath.</em></strong> The long burial rituals
that accompany a mummy's entombment help protect its body from rot. In
the embalming process, the newly dead creature's organs are removed and
placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils,
herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is
typically wrapped in linen bandages.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Will of Dark Gods.</em></strong> An undead mummy is
created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually
imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy's linen
wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial
ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in
undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual.
Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or
former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Punished.</em></strong> Once deceased, an individual
has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies
were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or
who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment,
they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed
away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from
slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creature of Ritual.</em></strong> A mummy obeys the
conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it,
driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that
foreshadows a mummy's attack can leave the intended victim paralyzed
with fright. In the days following a mummy's touch, a victim's body rots
from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ending a Mummy's Curse.</em></strong> Rare magic can undo
or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly
die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by
undoing the transgression that caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be
replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb,
or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed.</p>
<p>More ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as revealing a secret the
mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can't be so
easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the
creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Archives.</em></strong> Though they seldom bother
to do so, mummies can speak. As a result, some serve as undead
repositories of lost lore, and can be consulted by the descendants of
those who created them. Powerful individuals sometimes intentionally
sequester mummies away for occasional consultation.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A mummy doesn't require air,
food, drink, or sleep.</p>
