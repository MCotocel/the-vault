</blockquote>
<h2 id="young-black-dragon-1">Young Black Dragon</h2>
<p>The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black
dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These
dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of
humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling
ruins where kingdoms once stood.</p>
<p>With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's
face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored
near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon
ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though
eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal
appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its
tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds
to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.</p>
<p>When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages,
its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes
and blasted ruins that are its home.</p>
<p><strong><em>Brutal and Cruel.</em></strong> All chromatic dragons are
evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black
dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the
illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.</p>
<p>A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick
and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining
foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to
save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to
claim mastery over it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Foes and Servants.</em></strong> Black dragons hate and
fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for
opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a
stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks
out new territory.</p>
<p>Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid
settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude
draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.</p>
<p>A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the
spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay
good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.</p>
<p>Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They
become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening
captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them
to sate the dragon's hunger.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wealth of the Ancients.</em></strong> Black dragons hoard
the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms
to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon
outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current
civilizations for itself.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Black Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> Black dragons dwell
in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is
a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded,
providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can
ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous
victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by
crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair,
which is filled with the stench of death and decay.</p>
<h3 id="chromatic-dragons">Chromatic Dragons</h3>
<p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil
side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons
are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including
each other.</p>
<h4 id="driven-by-greed">Driven by Greed</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their
every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to
them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard
for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its
piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the
stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in
commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
<h4 id="creatures-of-ego">Creatures of Ego</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing
themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When
they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own
interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief
is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and
worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to
convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are
animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy
of respect.</p>
<h4 id="dangerous-lairs">Dangerous Lairs</h4>
<p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its
treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe
environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter
but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for
its hoard.</p>
<p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote
locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching
them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a
red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to
the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use
magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their
treasures.</p>
<h4 id="queen-of-evil-dragons">Queen of Evil Dragons</h4>
<p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She
dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god,
Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is
loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons,
believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers
and hers alone.</p>
<p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the
chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white.
She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies
with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her
fearsome claws.</p>
<p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom
she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special
enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus
and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>
