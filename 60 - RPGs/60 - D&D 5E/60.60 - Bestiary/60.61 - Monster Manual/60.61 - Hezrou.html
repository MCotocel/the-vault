</blockquote>
<h2 id="hezrou-1">Hezrou</h2>
<p>Hezrous serve as foot soldiers in the demonic hordes of the Abyss.
Although physically powerful, they are weak-minded and hezrous can
easily be duped into sacrificing themselves by more powerful demons. As
they press their attacks into the heart of an enemy's forces, their foul
stench can sicken even the toughest foes.</p>
<h1 id="demons">Demons</h1>
<p>Spawned in the Infinite Layers of the Abyss, demons are the
embodiment of chaos and evil-engines of destruction barely contained in
monstrous form. Possessing no compassion, empathy, or mercy, they exist
only to destroy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spawn of Chaos.</em></strong> The Abyss creates demons as
extensions of itself, spontaneously forming fiends out of filth and
carnage. Some are unique monstrosities, while others represent uniform
strains virtually identical to each other. Other demons (such as manes)
are created from mortal souls shunned or cursed by the gods, or which
are otherwise trapped in the Abyss.</p>
<p><strong><em>Capricious Elevation.</em></strong> Demons respect power
and power alone. A greater demon commands shrieking mobs of lesser
demons because it can destroy any lesser demon that dares to refuse its
commands. A demon's status grows with the blood it spills; the more
enemies that fall before it, the greater it becomes.</p>
<p>A demon might spawn as a manes, then become a dretch, and eventually
transform to a vrock after untold time spent fighting and surviving in
the Abyss. Such elevations are rare, however, for most demons are
destroyed before they attain significant power. The greatest of those
that do survive make up the ranks of the demon lords that threaten to
tear the Abyss apart with their endless warring.</p>
<p>By expending considerable magical power, demon lords can raise lesser
demons into greater forms, though such promotions never stem from a
demon's deeds or accomplishments. Rather, a demon lord might warp a
manes into a quasit when it needs an invisible spy, or turn an army of
dretches into hezrous when marching against a rival lord. Demon lords
only rarely elevate demons to the highest ranks, fearful of
inadvertently creating rivals to their own power.</p>
<p><strong><em>Abyssal Invasions.</em></strong> Wherever they wander
across the Abyss, demons search for portals to the other planes. They
crave the chance to slip free of their native realm and spread their
dark influence across the multiverse, undoing the works of the gods,
tearing down civilizations, and reducing the cosmos to despair and
ruin.</p>
<p>Some of the darkest legends of the mortal realm are built around the
destruction wrought by demons set loose in the world. As such, even
nations embroiled in bitter conflict will set their differences aside to
help contain an outbreak of demons, or to seal off abyssal breaches
before these fiends can break free.</p>
<p><strong><em>Signs of Corruption.</em></strong> Demons carry the stain
of abyssal corruption with them, and their mere presence changes the
world for the worse. Plants wither and die in areas where abyssal
breaches and demons appear. Animals shun the sites where a demon has
made a kill. The site of a demonic infestation might be fouled by a
stench that never abates, by areas of bitter cold or burning heat, or by
permanent shadows that mark the places where these fiends lingered.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eternal Evil.</em></strong> Outside the Abyss, death is a
minor nuisance that no demon fears. Mundane weapons can't stop these
fiends, and many demons are resistant to the energy of the most potent
spells. When a lucky hero manages to drop a demon in combat, the fiend
dissolves into foul ichor. It then instantly reforms in the Abyss, its
mind and essence intact even as its hatred is inflamed.</p>
<p>The only way to truly destroy a demon is to seek it in the Abyss and
kill it there.</p>
<p><strong><em>Protected Essence.</em></strong> A powerful demon can
take steps to safeguard its life essence, using secret methods and
abyssal metals to create an amulet into which part of that essence is
ceded. If the demon's abyssal form is ever destroyed, the amulet allows
the fiend to reform at a time and place of its choosing.</p>
<p>Obtaining a demonic amulet is a dangerous enterprise, and simply
seeking such a device risks drawing the attention of the demon that
created it. A creature possessing a demonic amulet can exact favors from
the demon whose life essence the amulet holds—or inflict great pain if
the fiend resists. If an amulet is destroyed, the demon that created it
is trapped in the Abyss for a year and a day.</p>
<p><strong><em>Demonic Cults.</em></strong> Despite the dark risks
involved in dealing with fiends, the mortal realm is filled with
creatures that covet demonic power. Demon lords manipulate these mortal
servants into performing ever greater acts of depravity, furthering the
demon lord's ambitions in exchange for magic and other boons. However, a
demon regards any mortals in its service as tools to use and then
discard at its whim, consigning their mortal souls to the Abyss.</p>
<p><strong><em>Demon Summoning.</em></strong> Few acts are as dangerous
as summoning a demon, and even mages who bargain freely with devils fear
the fiends of the Abyss. Though demons yearn to sow chaos on the
Material Plane, they show no gratitude when brought there, raging
against their prisons and demanding release.</p>
<p>Those who would risk summoning a demon might do so to wrest
information from it, press it into service, or send it on a mission that
only a creature of absolute evil can complete. Preparation is key, and
experienced summoners know the specific spells and magic items that can
force a demon to bend to another's will. If a single mistake is made, a
demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first
victim of its wrath.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bound Demons.</em></strong> The Book of Vile Darkness,
the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Iggwilv are the
foremost authorities on demonic matters. These ancient tomes describe
techniques that can trap the essence of a demon on the Material Plane,
placing it within a weapon, idol, or piece of jewelry and preventing the
fiend's return to the Abyss.</p>
<p>An object that binds a demon must be specially prepared with unholy
incantations and innocent blood. It radiates a palpable evil, chilling
and fouling the air around it. A creature that handles such an object
experiences unsettling dreams and wicked impulses, but is able to
control the demon whose essence is trapped within the object. Destroying
the object frees the demon, which immediately seeks revenge against its
binder.</p>
<p><strong><em>Demonic Possession.</em></strong> No matter how secure
its bindings, a powerful demon often finds a way to escape an object
that holds it. When a demonic essence emerges from its container, it can
possess a mortal host. Sometimes a fiend employs stealth to hide a
successful possession. Other times, it unleashes the full brunt of its
fiendish drives through its new form.</p>
<p>As long as the demon remains in possession of its host, the soul of
that host is in danger of being dragged to the Abyss with the demon if
it is exorcised from the flesh, or if the host dies. If a demon
possesses a creature and the object binding the demon is destroyed, the
possession lasts until powerful magic is used to drive the demonic
spirit out of its host.</p>
<h3 id="demon-lords">Demon Lords</h3>
<p>The chaotic power of the Abyss rewards demons of particular
ruthlessness and ingenuity with a dark blessing, transforming them into
unique fiends whose power can rival the gods. These demon lords rule
through cunning or brute force, hoping to one day claim the prize of
absolute control over all the Abyss.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reward for Outsiders.</em></strong> Although most demon
lords rise up from the vast and uncountable mobs of demons rampaging
across the Abyss, the plane also rewards outsiders that conquer any of
its infinite layers. The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after
Corellon Larethian cast her into the Abyss for betraying elvenkind.
Sages claim that the Dark Prince Graz'zt originated on some other plane
before stealing his abyssal title from another long-forgotten demon
lord.</p>
<p><strong><em>Power and Control.</em></strong> The greatest sign of a
demon lord's power is its ability to reshape an abyssal realm. A layer
of the Abyss controlled by a demon lord becomes a twisted reflection of
that fiend's vile personality, and demon lords seldom leave their realms
for fear of allowing another creature to reshape and seize it.</p>
<p>As with other demons, a demon lord that dies on another plane has its
essence return to the Abyss, where it reforms into a new body. Likewise,
a demon lord that dies in the Abyss is permanently destroyed. Most demon
lords keep a portion of their essence safely stored away to prevent such
a fate.</p>
<h4 id="baphomet">Baphomet</h4>
<p>The demon lord Baphomet, also known as the Horned King and the Prince
of Beasts, rules over minotaurs and other savage creatures. If he had
his way, civilization would crumble and all races would embrace their
base animal savagery.</p>
<p>The Prince of Beasts appears as a huge, black-furred minotaur with
iron horns, red eyes, and a blood-soaked mouth. His iron crown is topped
with the rotting heads of his enemies, while his dark armor is set with
spikes and skull-like serrations. He carries a huge glaive named
Heartcleaver, but often hurls it into the fray so as to face his enemies
with horns and hooves.</p>
<h4 id="demogorgon">Demogorgon</h4>
<p>The Sibilant Beast and the self-styled Prince of Demons, Demogorgon
yearns for nothing less than undoing the order of the multiverse. An
insane assemblage of features and drives, the Prince of Demons inspires
fear and hatred among other demons and demon lords.</p>
<p>Demogorgon towers three times the height of a human, his body as
sinuous as a snake's and as powerful as a great ape's. Suckered
tentacles take the place of his arms. His saurian lower torso ends in
webbed and clawed feet, and a forked tail whose whip-like tips are armed
with cruel blades. The Prince of Demons has two baleful baboon heads,
both of them mad. It is only the conflict between the two halves of his
dual nature that keeps the demon lord's ambitions in check.</p>
<h4 id="grazzt">Graz'zt</h4>
<p>The demon lord Graz'zt appears as a darkly handsome figure nearly
nine feet tall. Those who refer to the Dark Prince as the most humanoid
of the demon lords vastly underestimate the capacity for evil in his
scheming heart.</p>
<p>Graz'zt is a striking physical specimen, whose demonic nature shows
in his ebon skin, pointed ears, yellow fangs, crown of horns, and
six-fingered hands. He delights in finery, pageantry, and sating his
decadent desires with subjects and consorts alike, among whom incubi and
succubi are often his favorites.</p>
<h4 id="juiblex">Juiblex</h4>
<p>The demon lord of slimes and oozes, Juiblex is a stew of noxious
fluids that lurks in the abyssal depths. The wretched Faceless Lord
cares nothing for cultists or mortal servants, and its sole desire is to
turn all creatures into formless copies of its horrid self.</p>
<p>In its resting state, Juiblex spreads out in a noxious mass, bubbling
and filling the air with a profound stench. On the rare occasions when
creatures confront the demon lord, Juiblex draws itself up into a
shuddering cone of slime striated with veins of black and green. Baleful
red eyes swim within its gelatinous body, while dripping pseudopods of
ooze lash out hungrily at any creature they can reach.</p>
<h4 id="lolth">Lolth</h4>
<p>The Demon Queen of Spiders is the evil matron of the drow. Her every
thought is touched by malice, and the depth of her viciousness can
surprise even her most faithful priestesses. She directs her faithful
while she weaves plots across the worlds of the Material Plane, looking
forward to the time when her drow followers bring those worlds under her
control.</p>
<p>Lolth appears as a lithe, imperious drow matriarch when she manifests
to her followers in the mortal realm, which she does with unusual
frequency. When battle breaks out-or if she has a reason to remind her
followers to fear her—Lolth's lower body transforms into that of a huge
demonic spider, whose spike—tipped legs and mandibles tear foes
apart.</p>
<h4 id="orcus">Orcus</h4>
<p>Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood Lord, the demon
lord Orcus is worshiped by the undead and by living creatures that
channel the power of undeath. A brooding and nihilistic entity, Orcus
yearns to make the multiverse a place of death and darkness, forever
unchanging except by his will.</p>
<p>The Demon Prince of Undeath is a foul and corpulent creature, with a
humanoid torso, powerful goat legs, and the desiccated head of a ram.
His sore-ridden body stinks of disease, but his decaying head and
glowing red eyes are as a creature already dead. Great black bat wings
sprout from his back, stirring reeking air as he moves.</p>
<p>Orcus wields a malevolent artifact known as the Wand of Orcus, a
mace-like rod of obsidian topped by a humanoid skull. He surrounds
himself with undead, and living creatures not under his control are
anathema to him.</p>
<h4 id="yeenoghu">Yeenoghu</h4>
<p>Known as the Gnoll Lord and the Beast of Butchery, the demon lord
Yeenoghu hungers for slaughter and senseless destruction. Gnolls are his
mortal instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater atrocities in his
name. Delighting in sorrow and hopelessness, the Gnoll Lord yearns to
turn the world into a wasteland in which the last surviving gnolls tear
each other apart for the right to feast upon the dead.</p>
<p>Yeenoghu appears as a huge, scarred gnoll with a spiky crest of black
spines, and eyes that burn with emerald flame. His armor is a patchwork
of shields and breastplates claimed from fallen foes, and decorated by
those foes' flayed skins. Yeenoghu can summon a triple flail he calls
the Butcher, which he wields to deadly effect or wills to fly
independently into battle as he tears foes apart with teeth and
claws.</p>
<h4 id="other-demon-lords">Other Demon Lords</h4>
<p>No one knows the full number of demon lords that rage in the Abyss.
Given the infinite depths of that plane, powerful demons constantly rise
to become demon lords, then fall almost as quickly. Among the demon
lords whose power has endured long enough for demonologists to name them
are Fraz-Urb'luu, the Prince of Deception; Kostchtchie, the Prince of
Wrath; Pazuzu, Prince of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms; and Zuggtmoy, Lady
of Fungi.</p>
<h4 id="demon-types">Demon Types</h4>
<p>Demonologists organize the chaotic distribution of demons into broad
categories of power known as types. Most demons fit into one of six
major types, with the weakest categorized as Type 1 and the strongest as
Type 6. Demons outside the six main types are categorized as minor
demons and demon lords.</p>

<h5 id="demon-true-names">Demon True Names</h5>
<p>Though demons all have common names, every demon lord and every demon
of type 1 through 6 has a true name that it keeps secret. A demon can be
forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and
tomes are said to exist that list the true names of the most powerful
demons.</p>
<p>A mortal who learns a demon's true name can use powerful summoning
magic to call the demon from the Abyss and exercise some measure of
control over it. However, most demons brought to the Material Plane in
this manner do everything in their power to wreak havoc or sow discord
and strife.</p>
