<h2 id="stone-giant-1">Stone Giant</h2>
<p>Stone giants are reclusive, quiet, and peaceful as long as they are
left alone. Their granite-gray skin, gaunt features, and black, sunken
eyes endow stone giants with a stern countenance. They are private
creatures, hiding their lives and art away from the world.</p>
<p><strong><em>Inhabitants of a Stone World.</em></strong> Secluded
caves are the homes of the stone giants. Cavern networks are their
towns, rocky tunnels their roads, and underground streams their
waterways. Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast
spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely
cross.</p>
<p>In their dark, quiet caves, stone giants wordlessly chip away at
elaborate carvings, measuring time in the echoing drip of water into
cavern pools. In the deepest chambers of a stone giant settlement, far
from the chittering of bats or the patrols paced out by the giants' cave
bear companions, are holy places where silence and darkness are
complete. Stone takes on its most sacred quality in these cavern
cathedrals, their buttresses and columns carved with a beauty that
shames the legendary stone craft of the dwarves.</p>
<p><strong><em>Carvers and Seers.</em></strong> Among stone giants,
artistry ranks as the greatest virtue. They create intricate murals,
paint sprawling murals across cavern walls, and indulge in a wide
variety of other artistic disciplines. They esteem stone carving as the
greatest of skills.</p>
<p>Stone giants strive to draw shapes out of raw stone, which they
believe reveal meaning inspired by their god, Skoraeus Stonebones. The
giants appoint the tribe's best carvers as their leaders, shamans, and
prophets. The holy hands of such giants become the hands of the god as
they work.</p>
<p><strong><em>Graceful Athletes.</em></strong> Despite their great size
and musculature, stone giants are lithe and graceful. Skilled rock
throwers are granted positions of high rank in the giants' ordning,
testing and demonstrating their ability to hurl and catch enormous
boulders. Such giants take the front ranks when a tribe has cause to
defend its home or attack its enemies. However, even in combat, artistry
is key. A stone giant hurling a rock performs not just a feat of brute
strength but also one of stunning athleticism and poise.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dreamers under Sky.</em></strong> Stone giants view the
world outside their underground homes as a realm of dreams where nothing
is entirely true or real. They behave in the surface world the way
humanoids might behave in their own dreams, making little account for
their actions and never fully trusting what they see or hear. A promise
made above ground need not be kept. Insults can be made without apology.
Killing prey or sentient beings is no cause for guilt in the dreaming
world beneath the sky.</p>
<p>Stone giants lacking in athletic grace or artistic skill dwell at the
fringes of their society, serving as the tribe's outlying guardians and
far-wandering hunters. When trespassers stray too far into the mountain
territory of a stone giant clan, those guardians greet them with hurled
rocks and showers of splintered stone. Survivors of such encounters
spread tales of stone giant violence, never realizing how little those
brutes dwelling in the unreal dreaming world resemble their quiet and
artistic kin.</p>
<h1 id="giants">Giants</h1>
<p>Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked
beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures
were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell
from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans
scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and
traditions of old.</p>
<h3 id="old-as-legend">Old as Legend</h3>
<p>In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths,
monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in
desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands,
now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.</p>
<p>Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the
giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they
spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational
wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what
started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn
are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval
wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one
another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area
without a fight.</p>
<h3 id="the-ordning">The Ordning</h3>
<p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and
storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and
culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent
animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p>
<p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on
social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to
each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows
which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants
are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of
skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in
these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p>
<p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also
ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning,
followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill
giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p>
<p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill
giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest
ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an
inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a
giant of another type, merely rude.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="giant-gods">Giant Gods</h5>
<p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants,
forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either
again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their
birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam
but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly
villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p>
<p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons
represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for
cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost
giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all
giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many
good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm
giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage
to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to
Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden;
Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and
arrogant trickster.</p>
<p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults,
paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other
non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain
to make a giant an outcast.</p>
