The marid can breathe air and water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Elemental Demise.</em></strong> If the marid dies, its
body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, leaving behind only
equipment the marid was wearing or carrying.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The marid's innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell
attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components:</p>
<p>At will: <em>create or destroy water</em>, <em>detect evil and
good</em>, <em>detect magic</em>, <em>fog cloud</em>, <em>purify food
and drink</em> 3/day each: <em>tongues</em>, <em>water breathing</em>,
<em>water walk</em> 1/day each: <em>conjure elemental</em>
(<strong>water elemental</strong> only), <em>control water</em>,
<em>gaseous form</em>, <em>invisibility</em>, <em>plane shift</em></p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The marid makes two trident
attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Trident.</em></strong> <em>Melee or Ranged Weapon
Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target.
<em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage, or 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing
damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Water Jet.</em></strong> The marid magically shoots water
in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must
make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21
(6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to
20 feet away from the marid and knocked prone. On a success, a target
takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked
prone.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="marid-1">Marid</h2>
<p>Hailing from the Elemental Plane of Water, the marids are the most
wondrous of genie-kind. Although all genies wield great power, even the
lowliest marid sees itself as clearly superior to the flighty djinn, the
ground-hugging dao, and the fuming efreet. Large and piscine, marids are
a strange sight to behold, particularly when clad in the finely stitched
vests and colorful pantaloons they favor. They speak in voices as soft
as the sea breeze or as sonorous as storm waves breaking against a rocky
cliff. In flight, their lower bodies transform into columns of foamy
water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Water Lords.</em></strong> Water is a marid's native
element, and the genie can manipulate water in virtually any way it
desires. A marid can walk on water and breathe naturally beneath its
surface. It can create water or shape clouds of fog and mist from the
vapor in the air. It can even transform itself into mist, or use water
as a weapon to bludgeon its foes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Marid Homes.</em></strong> Marids are rare on the
Material Plane. They inhabit mighty and majestic coral fortresses
located in the Elemental Plane of Water. These citadels float in the
depths of the plane and contain opulent, air-filled chambers where
slaves and guests reside.</p>
<p>A marid doesn't expect much from its slaves, simply wanting to have
them for the status of ownership. Marids go out of their way to obtain
skilled slaves, and aren't above kidnapping mortal artists,
entertainers, or storytellers for use in their courts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Egotistical Hierarchs.</em></strong> All marids claim a
title of nobility, and the race is awash in shahs, sultans, muftis, and
khedives. Most of these titles are mere pretense on the part of the
self-important marids.</p>
<p>Marids treat all others-including other genies-as inferiors of
various grades, ranging from poor cousins to petty annoyances. They
tolerate djinn, dislike dao, and despise efreet.</p>
<p>Humanoids are among the lowest of the creatures that marids must
tolerate, although they sometimes deal with powerful wizards and
exceptional leaders on an almost-equal footing. Doing so has sometimes
proven to be a mistake, since wizards have managed to imprison marids in
conch shells, flasks, and decanters over the ages. Bribery and flattery
are the best means of dealing with marids, to which an obsequious mortal
is a creature that knows its place.</p>
<p><strong><em>Whimsical Storytellers.</em></strong> Marids are champion
tale-tellers, whose favorite legends emphasize the prowess of marids in
general and of the speaker in particular. Fanciful genies, they lie
often and creatively. They aren't always malicious in their deception,
but embellishments suit their fancy. Marids consider it a crime for a
lesser being to interrupt one of their tales, and offending a marid is a
sure way to invoke its wrath.</p>
<p><strong><em>Genies.</em></strong> Genies are rare elemental creatures
out of story and legend. Only a few can be found on the Material Plane.
The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish
palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.</p>
<p>Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are
majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of
entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the
gods and other genies can challenge their power.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creatures of the Elements.</em></strong> A genie is born
when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial
matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an
elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a
genie.</p>
<p>A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form.
That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and
apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although
they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given
physical form. They don't mate with other genies or produce genie
offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion
of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection
to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although
such offspring are rare.</p>
<p>When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was
wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a
pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of
water and foam.</p>
<p>In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound
to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when
bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their
native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes.
For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into
service.</p>
<p>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies,
asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect
the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a
creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn't beholden to any
noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie's
will and risk the consequences.</p>
<p>Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the
numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into
believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand
that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds-bow down
before them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rule or Be Ruled.</em></strong> Mortal slaves serve to
validate a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering
voices are music to a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves
prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view
slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to
nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their
slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil
genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent
that the slaves are no longer of use.</p>
<p><strong><em>Decadent Nobility.</em></strong> Noble genies are the
rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have
learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of
their desire. This constant indulgence has made them decadent, while
their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their
vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond
imagination.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Power of Worship.</em></strong> Genies acknowledge
the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship
them. They find the endless fawning and mewling of religious devotees
tiresome-except as it is directed toward them by their worshipful
slaves.</p>
