(1,800 XP) or 7 (2,900 XP) when part of a coven - <strong>Proficiency
Bonus</strong> +3 </em></strong> <strong><em>Innate
Spellcasting.</em></strong> The hag's innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can
innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:</p>
<p>At will: <em>detect magic</em>, <em>magic missile</em> 2/day each:
<em>plane shift</em> (self only), <em>ray of enfeeblement</em>,
<em>sleep</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The hag has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Night Hag Items.</em></strong> A night hag carries two
very rare magic items that she must craft for herself. If either object
is lost, the night hag will go to great lengths to retrieve it, as
creating a new tool takes time and effort. Heartstone: This lustrous
black gem allows a night hag to become ethereal while it is in her
possession. The touch of a heartstone also cures any disease. Crafting a
heartstone takes 30 days. Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a
result of a night hag's Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in
this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one
evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can
catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid
sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Claws (Hag Form Only).</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon
Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 +
4) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Shape.</em></strong> The hag magically polymorphs
into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her
statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or
carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she
dies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Etherealness.</em></strong> The hag magically enters the
Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag
must have a heartstone in her possession.</p>
<p><strong><em>Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).</em></strong> While on the
Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the
Material Plane. A <em>protection from evil and good</em> spell cast on
the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As long as the
contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last
for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its
hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the
target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was
evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the
target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the <em>greater
restoration</em> spell or similar magic.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="night-hag-1">Night Hag</h2>
<p>Sly and subversive, night hags want to see the virtuous turn to
villainy: love turned into obsession, kindness turned to hate, devotion
to disregard, and generosity to selfishness. Night hags take perverse
joy in corrupting mortals.</p>
<p>Night hags were once creatures of the Feywild, but their foulness saw
them exiled to Hades long ago, where they degenerated into fiends. The
night hags have long since spread across the Lower Planes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Soulmongers.</em></strong> While a humanoid sleeps, a
night hag can straddle the person ethereally and intrude upon its
dreams. Any creature with truesight can see the hag's spectral form
straddling its prey. The ethereal hag fills her victim's head with
doubts and fears, in the hope of tricking it into performing evil acts
in the waking world. The hag continues her nightly visitations until the
victim finally expires in its sleep. If the hag has driven her victim to
commit evil deeds, she traps its corrupted soul in her soul bag (see the
"Night Hag Items" sidebar) for transport to Hades.</p>
<p><strong><em>Covens.</em></strong> A night hag that is part of a coven
(see the "Hag Covens" sidebar) has a challenge rating of 7 (2,900
XP).</p>

</blockquote>
<h1 id="hags">Hags</h1>
<p>Hags represent all that is evil and cruel. Though they resemble
withered crones, there is nothing mortal about these monstrous
creatures, whose forms reflect only the wickedness in their hearts.</p>
<h3 id="faces-of-evil">Faces of Evil</h3>
<p>Ancient beings with origins in the Feywild, hags are cankers on the
mortal world. Their withered faces are framed by long, frayed hair,
horrid moles and warts dot their blotchy skin, and their long, skinny
fingers are tipped by claws that can slice open flesh with a touch.
Their simple clothes are always tattered and filthy.</p>
<p>All hags possess magical powers, and some have an affinity for
spellcasting. They can alter their forms or curse their foes, and their
arrogance inspires them to view their magic as a challenge to the magic
of the gods, whom they blaspheme at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Hags name themselves in darkly whimsical ways, claiming monikers such
as Black Morwen, Peggy Pigknuckle, Grandmother Titchwillow, Nanna Shug,
Rotten Ethel, or Auntie Wormtooth.</p>
<h3 id="monstrous-motherhood">Monstrous Motherhood</h3>
<p>Hags propagate by snatching and devouring human infants. After
stealing a baby from its cradle or its mother's womb, the hag consumes
the poor child. A week later, the hag gives birth to a daughter who
looks human until her thirteenth birthday, whereupon the child
transforms into the spitting image of her hag mother.</p>
<p>Hags sometimes raise the daughters they spawn, creating covens. A hag
might also return the child to its grieving parents, only to watch from
the shadows as the child grows up to become a horror.</p>
<h3 id="dark-bargains">Dark Bargains</h3>
<p>Arrogant to a fault, hags believe themselves to be the most cunning
of creatures, and they treat all others as inferior. Even so, a hag is
open to dealing with mortals as long as those mortals show the proper
respect and deference. Over their long lives, hags accumulate much
knowledge of local lore, dark creatures, and magic, which they are
pleased to sell.</p>
<p>Hags enjoy watching mortals bring about their own downfall, and a
bargain with a hag is always dangerous. The terms of such bargains
typically involve demands to compromise principles or give up something
dear-especially if the thing lost diminishes or negates the knowledge
gained through the bargain.</p>
<h3 id="a-foul-nature">A Foul Nature</h3>
<p>Hags love the macabre and festoon their garb with dead things and
accentuate their appearance with bones, bits of flesh, and filth. They
nurture blemishes and pick at wounds to produce weeping, suppurating
flesh. Attractive creatures evoke disgust in a hag, which might "help"
such creatures by disfiguring or transforming them.</p>
<p>This embrace of the disturbing and unpleasant extends to all aspects
of a hag's life. A hag might fly in a magical giant's skull, landing it
on a tree shaped to resemble an enormous headless body. Another might
travel with a menagerie of monsters and slaves kept in cages, and
disguised by illusions to lure unwary creatures close. Hags sharpen
their teeth on millstones and spin cloth from the intestines of their
victims, reacting with glee to the horror their actions invoke.</p>
<h3 id="dark-sorority">Dark Sorority</h3>
<p>Hags maintain contact with each other and share knowledge. Through
such contacts, it is likely that any given hag knows of every other hag
in existence. Hags don't like each other, but they abide by an ageless
code of conduct. Hags announce their presence before crossing into
another hag's territory, bring gifts when entering another hag's
dwelling, and break no oaths given to other hags-as long as the oath
isn't given with the fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Some humanoids make the mistake of thinking that the hags' rules of
conduct apply to all creatures. When confronted by such an individual, a
hag might find it amusing to string the fool along for a while before
teaching it a permanent lesson.</p>
<h3 id="dark-lairs">Dark Lairs</h3>
<p>Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed
seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag's lair
reflects the creature's noxiousness, such that the land itself can
attack and kill trespassers. Trees twisted by darkness attack passersby,
while vines snake through the undergrowth to snare and drag off
creatures one at a time. Foul stinking fogs turn the air to poison, and
conceal pools of quicksand and sinkholes that consume unwary
wanderers.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="hag-covens">Hag Covens</h5>
<p>When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are
equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire
more personal power.</p>
<p>A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags
can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together,
as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually
chaos.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shared Spellcasting.</em></strong> While all three
members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each
cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share
the spell slots among themselves:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>1st level (4 slots): <em>identify</em>, <em>ray of
sickness</em></li>
<li>2nd level (3 slots): <em>hold person</em>, <em>locate
object</em></li>
<li>3rd level (3 slots): <em>bestow curse</em>, <em>counterspell</em>,
<em>lightning bolt</em></li>
<li>4th level (3 slots): <em>phantasmal killer</em>,
<em>polymorph</em></li>
<li>5th level (2 slots): <em>contact other plane</em>,
<em>scrying</em></li>
<li>6th level (1 slot): <em>eyebite</em></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that
uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12 +
the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4 + the
hag's Intelligence modifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Hag Eye.</em></strong> A hag coven can craft a magic item
called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and
often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually
entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven
can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the
same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven
member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new
one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The
ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During
the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the
ritual, they must start over.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful
aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties
usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any
lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the
save DC of the hag's most powerful ability.</p>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a
lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the
same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass
through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces
weren't there.</li>
<li>The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see,
causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can
be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to
force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses
this lair action again to open them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful night hag might have the following additional lair
actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>One creature the hag can see within 120 feet of her must succeed on
a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a prison demiplane. To
escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check
contested by the hag's. If the creature wins, it escapes the demiplane.
Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round.
When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in
the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>
<li>The hag targets up to three creatures that she can see within 60
feet of her. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or be flung up to 30 feet through the air. A creature that strikes
a solid object or is released in midair takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for
every 10 feet moved or fallen.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the
home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the
lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders.
Any regional effect that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses
the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability. These effects either end
immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to 2d10
days to fade away.</p>
<p>The region within 1 mile of a grandmother hag's lair is warped by the
creature's fell magic, which creates one or more of the following
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Birds, rodents, snakes, spiders, or toads (or some other
creatures appropriate to the hag) are found in great profusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Beasts that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed
by the hag and directed to be aggressive toward intruders in the
area.</p></li>
<li><p>Strange carved figurines, twig fetishes, or rag dolls magically
appear in trees.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A powerful night hag creates one or more of the following additional
regional effects within 1 mile of her lair:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shadows seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move on their own as
though alive.</li>
<li>Creatures are transported to a harmless but eerie demiplane filled
with shadowy forms, waxy corpses, and cackling. The creatures are
trapped there for a minute or two, and then returned to the place where
they vanished from.</li>
<li>Intelligent creatures see hallucinations of dead friends, family
members, and even themselves littering the hag's realm. Any attempt to
interact with a hallucinatory image causes it to disappear.</li>
</ul>
