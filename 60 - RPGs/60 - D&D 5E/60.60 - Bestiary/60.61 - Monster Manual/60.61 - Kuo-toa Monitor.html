<h2 id="kuo-toa-monitor-1">Kuo-toa Monitor</h2>
<p>Kuo-toa are degenerate fishlike humanoids that once inhabited the
shores and islands of the surface world. Long ago humans and their ilk
drove the kuo-toa underground, where they dwell in madness and
everlasting night. Kuo-toa can no longer abide daylight.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mad Slaves.</em></strong> At the height of the illithid
empire, the mind flayers captured kuo-toa by the thousands and forced
them into bondage. The kuo-toa were simple creatures, never meant to
endure the oppressive mental force the illithids unleashed against them.
By the time the mind flayers abandoned them, the prolonged psychic
subjugation endured by the kuo-toa had driven them mad.</p>
<p>Their minds shattered beyond repair, the kuo-toa adopted a religious
fervor, inventing gods to protect them against threats. Most notable of
these threats are the drow, which have slain the kuo-toa on sight since
the days when the two races first met.</p>
<p><strong><em>God Makers.</em></strong> Kuo-toa worship gods of their
own insane creation, but if enough kuo-toa believe that a god is real,
the energy of their collective subconscious can cause that god to
manifest as a physical entity. The form a kuo-toa god takes depends on
the inspiration for its divine image, and is usually random or
nonsensical.</p>
<p>One of the most revered gods of the kuo-toa is Blibdoolpoolp the Sea
Mother, who takes the form of a female human with a crayfish head, a
crayfish's claws, and an articulated shell covering her shoulders.
Blibdoolpoolp was likely invented by a kuo-toa that improved on a broken
human statue by adding the limbs and head of a crustacean. In sudden awe
of its handiwork, it then named the resulting form a god.</p>
<p>Kuo-toa that cross paths with an aboleth often find themselves
worshiping it as a god, their madness blinding them to the fact that the
aboleth is merely using them for its own nefarious ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Theocratic Rulers.</em></strong> Kuo-toa archpriests are
surrounded by fanatical devotees of their faith. The archpriest of a
kuo-toa domain demands that all its subjects worship a specific god. An
archpriest's mad belief in its god is so fervent that it manifests the
powers of a high cleric. The archpriest can also bestow spells to devout
underlings called whips. One or more of these whips are also the
archpriest's children, and their primary role in kuo-toan society is to
fight to the death to claim the throne when the archpriest dies. If a
whip displeases the archpriest, the archpriest can strip it of its
spellcasting ability, if not its life.</p>
<p>The archpriest's decrees are enforced by monitors, devout kuo-toa
that act as the archpriest's eyes and ears. Monitors are deadly
hand-to-hand combatants, and lesser kuo-toa live in fear of them.</p>
<p>Kuo-toa Gear. Many weapons of the kuo-toa are designed to capture
rather than kill. Nets are common, though some carry pincer staffs (also
called mancatchers) designed to trap and immobilize foes. Kuo-toa
warriors also treat their shields with a sticky goo that catches
incoming weapons.</p>
<p>In general, kuo-toa don't like the weight of armor on their slippery
bodies and rely on their natural rubbery hides for protection. However,
they like to wear jewelry made from scavenged bones, shells, pearls,
gems, and carapace fragments.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="variant-kuo-toa-monitor">Variant: Kuo-toa Monitor</h5>
<p>A kuo-toa monitor has a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP). It has the
same statistics as a kuo-toa whip except that it adds its Wisdom
modifier to its Armor Class (AC 13), loses the Spellcaster trait, and
replaces the whip's action options with the following action
options.</p>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The kuo-toa makes one bite
attack and two unarmed strikes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Unarmed Strike.</em></strong> Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage + 3
(1d6) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the
end of the kuo-toa's next turn.</p>
