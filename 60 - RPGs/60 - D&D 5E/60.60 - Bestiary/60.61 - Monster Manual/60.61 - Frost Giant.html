<h2 id="frost-giant-1">Frost Giant</h2>
<p>Gigantic reavers from the freezing lands beyond civilization, frost
giants are fierce, hardy warriors that survive on the spoils of their
raids and pillaging. They respect only brute strength and skill in
battle, demonstrating both with their scars and the grisly trophies they
take from their enemies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hearts of Ice.</em></strong> Frost giants are creatures
of ice and snow. Their hair and beards are pale white or light blue,
matted with frost and clattering with icicles. Their flesh is as blue as
glacial ice.</p>
<p>Frost giants dwell in high peaks and glacial rifts where the sun
hides its golden head by winter. Crops don't grow in their frozen
homelands, and they keep little livestock beyond what they capture in
their raids against civilized lands. They hunt the wild game of the
tundra and mountains but don't cook it, since meat from a fresh kill
tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reavers of the Storm.</em></strong> The war horns of the
frost giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses and glacial
rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that storm clears, villages and
steadings lay in ruins, ravens descending to feed on the corpses of any
creatures foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants' path.</p>
<p>Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted
and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled,
their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of
moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for
coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be
worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for
trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal
weapons and armor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rulers by Might.</em></strong> Frost giants respect brute
strength above all else, and a frost giant's place in the ordning
depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature,
scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of
slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are
given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.</p>
<p>When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is
unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble
festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and
challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic
free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees,
shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes avalanches on the snowy
mountainsides.</p>
<p><strong><em>Make War, Not Goods.</em></strong> Though frost giants
consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and
leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins
and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the
handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their
smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword
blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle
trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls
wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon's
teeth or claws.</p>
<h1 id="giants">Giants</h1>
<p>Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked
beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures
were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell
from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans
scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and
traditions of old.</p>
<h3 id="old-as-legend">Old as Legend</h3>
<p>In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths,
monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in
desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands,
now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.</p>
<p>Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the
giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they
spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational
wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what
started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn
are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval
wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one
another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area
without a fight.</p>
<h3 id="the-ordning">The Ordning</h3>
<p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and
storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and
culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent
animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p>
<p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on
social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to
each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows
which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants
are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of
skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in
these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p>
<p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also
ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning,
followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill
giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p>
<p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill
giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest
ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an
inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a
giant of another type, merely rude.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="giant-gods">Giant Gods</h5>
<p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants,
forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either
again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their
birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam
but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly
villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p>
<p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons
represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for
cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost
giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all
giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many
good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm
giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage
to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to
Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden;
Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and
arrogant trickster.</p>
<p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults,
paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other
non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain
to make a giant an outcast.</p>
