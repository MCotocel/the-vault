ft. - <strong>Challenge</strong> 5 (1,800 XP) - <strong>Proficiency
Bonus</strong> +3 </em></strong> <strong><em>Charge.</em></strong> If
the unicorn moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then
hits it with a horn attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9
(2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a
DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The unicorn's innate
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The unicorn can
innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:</p>
<p>At will: <em>detect evil and good</em>, <em>druidcraft</em>, <em>pass
without trace</em> 1/day each: <em>calm emotions</em>, <em>dispel evil
and good</em>, <em>entangle</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The unicorn has advantage
on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Weapons.</em></strong> The unicorn's weapon attacks
are magical.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The unicorn makes two attacks:
one with its hooves and one with its horn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hooves.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horn.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Healing Touch (3/Day).</em></strong> The unicorn touches
another creature with its horn. The target magically regains 11 (2d8 +
2) hit points. In addition, the touch removes all diseases and
neutralizes all poisons afflicting the target.</p>
<p><strong><em>Teleport (1/Day).</em></strong> The unicorn magically
teleports itself and up to three willing creatures it can see within 5
feet of it, along with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, to a
location the unicorn is familiar with, up to 1 mile away.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The unicorn can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The unicorn regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hooves.</strong> The unicorn makes one attack with its
hooves.</li>
<li><strong>Shimmering Shield (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The unicorn
creates a shimmering, magical field around itself or another creature it
can see within 60 feet of it. The target gains a +2 bonus to AC until
the end of the unicorn's next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Heal Self (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> The unicorn magically
regains 11 (2d8 + 2) hit points.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="unicorn-1">Unicorn</h2>
<p>Unicorns dwell in enchanted forests. Unrelated to the horses it
resembles, a unicorn is a celestial creature that wanders sylvan realms,
its white form glimmering like starlight.</p>
<p>A unicorn's brow sports a single spiraling horn of ivory whose
magical touch can heal the sick and the injured. Its ears catch the
words and whispers of the creatures that share its domain, and it knows
the tongues of elves and sylvan folk. Unicorns allow good-hearted
creatures to enter their woods to hunt or gather food, but they hold
evil ever at bay. Foul-hearted creatures seldom leave a unicorn's domain
alive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Divine Guardians.</em></strong> Good deities placed
unicorns on the Material Plane to ward away evil and preserve and
protect sacred places. Most unicorns protect a bounded realm such as an
enchanted forest. However, the gods sometimes send a unicorn to guard
sacred artifacts or protect specific creatures. When the forces of
darkness strike against an individual the gods wish to protect, they
might send that individual to a unicorn's forest, where evil creatures
pursue at their peril.</p>
<p>Unicorns most often serve deities of the forest and woodlands,
including the gods of benevolent fey.</p>
<p>Although all unicorns have natural healing power, some serve the gods
in greater capacities, performing miracles normally reserved for high
priests.</p>
<p><strong><em>Forest Lords.</em></strong> A unicorn's forest is a
celestial realm where nothing that occurs beneath the sun-dappled leaves
escapes the creature's notice. A unicorn hears each breathy tune sung by
the elves that reside amid the treetops. It senses where every
caterpillar spins its cocoon, each leaf and branch upon which a bright
butterfly rests its tired wings.</p>
<p>In a unicorn's forest, a sense of calm pervades. From wolves and
foxes to birds, squirrels, and tiny insects, the creatures of a
unicorn's domain seem quite tame.</p>
<p>Pixies, sprites, satyrs, dryads, and other normally mercurial fey
loyally serve a unicorn when they dwell within its woods. Under a
unicorn's protection, creatures feel safe from the threat of encroaching
civilization and the insidious spread of evil.</p>
<p>A unicorn roams its domain constantly, moving ever so carefully so as
not to disturb other denizens. A creature might catch a passing glimpse
of the unicorn then suddenly see nothing but the wild woods.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sacred Horns.</em></strong> A unicorn's horn is the focus
of its power, a shard of divine magic wrought in spiraling ivory. Wands
of unicorn horn channel powerful magic, while unicorn horn weapons
strike with divine force.</p>
<p>Wizards can work powdered unicorn horn into potent potions and scroll
ink, or use it as a component in eldritch rituals. However, any creature
that takes a role, no matter how small, in slaying a unicorn is likely
to become the target of divine retribution.</p>
<p><strong><em>Blessed Mounts.</em></strong> When darkness and evil
threaten to overwhelm the mortal world, the gods sometimes see fit to
pair a unicorn mount with a champion. A paladin astride a unicorn is a
sign of the gods' direct intervention in the affairs of the mortal
realm. It is a holy alliance made to cleave the heads from demons and
banish devils back to the Nine Hells.</p>
<p>As long as the troubled times of darkness persist, the unicorn stays
by the champion, its horn shining brightly to drive back the night.
However, if the gods' champion falls from grace or turns from the cause
of righteousness and good, the unicorn departs, never to return.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Unicorn's Lair.</em></strong> A unicorn's lair might be
an ancient ruin overgrown with vines, a misty clearing surrounded by
mighty oaks, a flower-covered hilltop alive with butterflies, or some
other serene woodland location.</p>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>Transformed by the creature's celestial presence, the domain of a
unicorn might include any of the following magical effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open flames of a non magical nature are extinguished within the
unicorn's domain. Torches and campfires refuse to burn, but closed
lanterns are unaffected.</li>
<li>Creatures native to the unicorn's domain have an easier time hiding;
they have advantage on all Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.</li>
<li>When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect
that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the
target regains the maximum number of hit points possible for the spell
or effect.</li>
<li>Curses affecting any good-aligned creature are suppressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the unicorn dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
