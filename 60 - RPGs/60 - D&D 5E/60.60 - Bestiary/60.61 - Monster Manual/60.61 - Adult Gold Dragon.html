<strong><em>Amphibious.</em></strong> The dragon can breathe air and
water.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong> If the dragon
fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its
Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +14 to
hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the
dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it
must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to
the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5–6).</em></strong> The dragon
uses one of the following breath weapons. - <strong>Fire Breath</strong>
The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area
must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) fire damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. -
<strong>Weakening Breath</strong> The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot
cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving
throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls, Strength
checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A creature can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Shape.</em></strong> The dragon magically
polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no
higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true
form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or
borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon
retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak,
proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and
capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any
class features or legendary actions of that form.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect.</strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon beats its
wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC
22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="adult-gold-dragon-1">Adult Gold Dragon</h2>
<p>The most powerful and majestic of the metallic dragons, gold dragons
are dedicated foes of evil.</p>
<p>A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that
resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing
twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings
start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it
fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A
gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks.
Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages,
its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.</p>
<p><strong><em>Devourer of Wealth.</em></strong> Gold dragons can eat
just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and
gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such
wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well
received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reserved Shapeshifters.</em></strong> Gold dragons are
respected by the other metallic dragons for their wisdom and fairness,
but they are the most aloof and grim of the good-aligned dragons. They
value their privacy to the extent that they rarely fraternize with other
dragons except their own mates and offspring.</p>
<p>Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does
a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a
peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip,
patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In
the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a
wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or
weeks on end.</p>
<p><strong><em>Master Hoarders.</em></strong> A gold dragon keeps its
hoard in a well-guarded vault deep within its lair. Magical wards placed
on the vault make it all but impossible to remove any treasures without
the dragon knowing about it.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Gold Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> Gold dragons make
their homes in out-of-the-way places, where they can do as they please
without arousing suspicion or fear. Most dwell near idyllic lakes and
rivers, mist-shrouded islands, cave complexes hidden behind sparkling
waterfalls, or ancient ruins.</p>
<h3 id="metallic-dragons">Metallic Dragons</h3>
<p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as
one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the
world.</p>
<h4 id="noble-curiosity">Noble Curiosity</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but
they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather,
metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed
relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure
hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history,
and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other
creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even
evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's
hoard.</p>
<p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard
for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to
the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic
dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
<h4 id="solitary-shapeshifters">Solitary Shapeshifters</h4>
<p>At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical
ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon
learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures
for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their
lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city
streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and
amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
<p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as
possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are
often far out of touch with current events.</p>
<h4 id="the-persistence-of-memory">The Persistence of Memory</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of
humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons
can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person
they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with
over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a
cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart
as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might
resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the
dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
<h4 id="king-of-good-dragons">King of Good Dragons</h4>
<p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often
wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human
male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven
golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed
form.</p>
<p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though
he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon
Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes
worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a
lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>

<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use
the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dragon glimpses the future, so it has advantage on attack rolls,
ability checks, and saving throws until initiative count 20 on the next
round.</li>
<li>One creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed
on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a dream plane, a
different plane of existence the dragon has imagined into being. To
escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check
contested by the dragon's. If the creature wins, it escapes the dream
plane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next
round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left
or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Additional Lair Action.</em></strong> At your discretion,
a legendary (<strong>adult</strong> or <strong>ancient</strong>) gold
dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its
lair:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beguiling Glow</strong> Warm light fills a 30-foot-radius
sphere centered on the dragon; each creature in that area must succeed
on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the dragon until
initiative count 20 on the next round.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary gold dragon's lair is warped by the
dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters
a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the
dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse
with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the
dragon upon waking.</li>
<li>Banks of beautiful, opalescent mist manifest within 6 miles of the
dragon's lair. The mist doesn't obscure anything. It assumes haunting
forms when evil creatures are near the dragon or other non-evil
creatures in the mist, warning such creatures of the danger.</li>
<li>Gems and pearls within 1 mile of the dragon's lair sparkle and
gleam, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, these effects end immediately.</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional Regional Effects.</em></strong> Any of these
effects might appear in the area around a gold dragon's lair, in
addition to or instead of the effects described in the <em>Monster
Manual</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beneficent Trail</strong> Within 10 miles of the dragon's
lair, small runes in the shape of a gold dragon appear to creatures in
great need, marking a subtle trail leading to the dragon's lair.</li>
<li><strong>Emanation of Justice</strong> Creatures that spend a year
within 6 miles of the dragon's lair value fairness and justice over
their personal feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Liar's Revelation</strong> Within 6 miles of the dragon's
lair, any creature attempting to tell a deliberate lie must succeed on a
DC 15 Charisma saving throw or find itself accidentally revealing the
truth it was attempting to conceal. The first time a creature fails this
saving throw, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
