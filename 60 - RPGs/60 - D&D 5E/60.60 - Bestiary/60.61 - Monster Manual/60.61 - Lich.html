</em></strong> <strong><em>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</em></strong>
If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rejuvenation.</em></strong> If it has a phylactery, a
destroyed lich gains a new body in 1d10 days, regaining all its hit
points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of
the phylactery.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> The lich is an 18th-level
spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20,
+12 to hit with spell attacks). The lich has the following wizard spells
prepared:</p>
<p>Cantrips (at will): <em>mage hand</em>, <em>prestidigitation</em>,
<em>ray of frost</em> 1st level (4 slots): <em>detect magic</em>,
<em>magic missile</em>, <em>shield</em>, <em>thunderwave</em> 2nd level
(3 slots): <em>detect thoughts</em>, <em>invisibility</em>, <em>Melf's
acid arrow</em>, <em>mirror image</em> 3rd level (3 slots): <em>animate
dead</em>, <em>counterspell</em>, <em>dispel magic</em>,
<em>fireball</em> 4th level (3 slots): <em>blight</em>, <em>dimension
door</em> 5th level (3 slots): <em>cloudkill</em>, <em>scrying</em> 6th
level (1 slot): <em>disintegrate</em>, <em>globe of invulnerability</em>
7th level (1 slot): <em>finger of death</em>, <em>plane shift</em> 8th
level (1 slot): <em>dominate monster</em>, <em>power word stun</em> 9th
level (1 slot): <em>power word kill</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Turn Resistance.</em></strong> The lich has advantage on
saving throws against any effect that turns undead.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Paralyzing Touch.</em></strong> <em>Melee Spell
Attack:</em> +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 10
(3d6) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution
saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The lich can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The lich regains spent legendary actions
at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cantrip.</strong> The lich casts a cantrip.</li>
<li><strong>Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The lich uses
its Paralyzing Touch.</li>
<li><strong>Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The lich fixes
its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target
must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become
frightened for 1 minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for
it, the target is immune to the lich's gaze for the next 24 hours.</li>
<li><strong>Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions).</strong> Each non-undead
creature within 20 feet of the lich must make a DC 18 Constitution
saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lich-1">Lich</h2>
<p>Liches are the remains of great wizards who embrace undeath as a
means of preserving themselves. They further their own power at any
cost, having no interest in the affairs of the living except where those
affairs interfere with their own. Scheming and insane, they hunger for
long-forgotten knowledge and the most terrible secrets. Because the
shadow of death doesn't hang over them, they can conceive plans that
take years, decades, or centuries to come to fruition.</p>
<p>A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh stretched
tight across its bones. Its eyes succumbed to decay long ago, but points
of light burn in its empty sockets. It is often garbed in the moldering
remains of fine clothing and jewelry worn and dulled by the passage of
time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Secrets of Undeath.</em></strong> No wizard takes up the
path to lichdom on a whim, and the process of becoming a lich is a
well-guarded secret. Wizards that seek lichdom must make bargains with
fiends, evil gods, or other foul entities. Many turn to Orcus, Demon
Prince of Undeath, whose power has created countless liches. However,
those that control the power of lichdom always demand fealty and service
for their knowledge.</p>
<p>A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul
within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world,
preventing it from traveling to the Outer Planes after death. A
phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but
it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space into which
arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are
scribed in silver.</p>
<p>With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of
transformation-a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a
sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard
falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the
phylactery, where it forever remains.</p>
<p><strong><em>Soul Sacrifices.</em></strong> A lich must periodically
feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body
and consciousness. It does this using the <em>imprisonment</em> spell.
Instead of choosing one of the normal options of the spell, the lich
uses the spell to magically trap the target's body and soul inside its
phylactery. The phylactery must be on the same plane as the lich for the
spell to work. A lich's phylactery can hold only one creature at a time,
and a <em>dispel magic</em> cast as a 9th-level spell upon the
phylactery releases any creature imprisoned within it. A creature
imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed
utterly, whereupon nothing short of divine intervention can restore it
to life.</p>
<p>A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed
souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a
demilich.</p>
<p><strong><em>Death and Restoration.</em></strong> When a lich's body
is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains
from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body
reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke
that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery
means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its
phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.</p>
<p>Destroying a lich's phylactery is no easy task and often requires a
special ritual, item, or weapon. Every phylactery is unique, and
discovering the key to its destruction can be a quest in and of
itself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lonely Existence.</em></strong> From time to time, a lich
might be stirred from its single-minded pursuit of power to take an
interest in the world around it, most often when some great event
reminds it of the life it once led. It otherwise lives in isolation,
engaging only with those creatures whose service helps secure its
lair.</p>
<p>Few liches call themselves by their former names, instead adopting
monikers such as the Black Hand or the Forgotten King.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Collectors.</em></strong> Liches collect spells and
magic items. In addition to its spell repertoire, a lich has ready
access to potions, scrolls, libraries of spellbooks, one or more wands,
and perhaps a staff or two. It has no qualms about putting these
treasures to use whenever its lair comes under attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A lich doesn't require air,
food, drink, or sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Lich's Lair.</em></strong> A lich often haunts the
abode it favored in life, such as a lonely tower, a haunted ruin, or an
academy of black magic. Alternatively, some liches construct secret
tombs filled with powerful guardians and traps. Everything about a
lich's lair reflects its keen mind and wicked cunning, including the
magic and mundane traps that secure it. Undead, constructs, and bound
demons lurk in shadowy recesses, emerging to destroy those who dare to
disturb the lich's work.</p>
<p>A lich encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 22 (41,000
XP).</p>
<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lich can take a
lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the lich
can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The lich rolls a d8 and regains a spell slot of that level or
lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing
happens.</p></li>
<li><p>The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A
crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target.
Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the
damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This
tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the
lich or the target is no longer in the lich's lair.</p></li>
<li><p>The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its
lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the
lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18
Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then
disappear.</p></li>
</ul>
