(3/Day).</em></strong> If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose
to succeed instead.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The dragon can use its
Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +15 to
hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claw.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +15 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tail.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +15 to
hit, reach 20 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Frightful Presence.</em></strong> Each creature of the
dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it
must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to
the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5â€“6).</em></strong> The dragon
uses one of the following breath weapons. - <strong>Acid Breath</strong>
The dragon exhales acid in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each
creature in that line must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking
63 (14d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. - <strong>Slowing Breath</strong> The dragon exhales gas
in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 22
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use
reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack
on its turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute.
The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful save.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Shape.</em></strong> The dragon magically
polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no
higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true
form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or
borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form, the dragon
retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak,
proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and
capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any
class features or legendary actions of that form.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the
end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Detect.</strong> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception)
check.</li>
<li><strong>Tail Attack.</strong> The dragon makes a tail attack.</li>
<li><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong> The dragon beats its
wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC
23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ancient-copper-dragon-1">Ancient Copper Dragon</h2>
<p>Copper dragons are incorrigible pranksters, joke tellers, and
riddlers that live in hills and rocky uplands. Despite their gregarious
and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and
can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.</p>
<p>A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back
to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its
backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth,
a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the
dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a
green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the
eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Good Hosts.</em></strong> A copper dragon appreciates
wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes
annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its
tricks with good humor.</p>
<p>Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve
out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale
it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such
companionship is a treasure to be coveted.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cautious and Crafty.</em></strong> When building its
hoard, a copper dragon prefers treasures from the earth. Metals and
precious stones are favorites of these creatures.</p>
<p>A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions.
If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a
copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might
send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the
object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Copper Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> Copper dragons
dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in
narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the
dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has
collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open
caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the
real treasure is hidden.</p>
<h3 id="metallic-dragons">Metallic Dragons</h3>
<p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as
one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the
world.</p>
<h4 id="noble-curiosity">Noble Curiosity</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but
they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather,
metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed
relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure
hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history,
and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other
creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even
evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's
hoard.</p>
<p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard
for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to
the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic
dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
<h4 id="solitary-shapeshifters">Solitary Shapeshifters</h4>
<p>At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical
ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon
learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures
for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their
lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city
streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and
amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
<p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as
possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are
often far out of touch with current events.</p>
<h4 id="the-persistence-of-memory">The Persistence of Memory</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of
humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons
can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person
they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with
over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a
cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart
as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might
resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the
dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
<h4 id="king-of-good-dragons">King of Good Dragons</h4>
<p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often
wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human
male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven
golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed
form.</p>
<p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though
he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon
Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes
worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a
lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>

<h4 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h4>
<p>On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to cause one of the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dragon chooses a point on the ground that it can see within 120
feet of it. Stone spikes sprout from the ground in a 20-foot radius
centered on that point. The effect is otherwise identical to the
<em>spike growth</em> spell and lasts until the dragon uses this lair
action again or until the dragon dies.</li>
<li>The dragon chooses a 10-foot-square area on the ground that it can
see within 120 feet of it. The ground in that area turns into
3-foot-deep mud. Each creature on the ground in that area when the mud
appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink into the
mud and become restrained. A creature can take an action to attempt a DC
15 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach
and ending the restrained condition on a success. Moving 1 foot in the
mud costs 2 feet of movement. On initiative count 20 on the next round,
the mud hardens, and the Strength DC to work free increases to 20.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Additional Lair Actions.</em></strong> At your
discretion, a legendary (<strong>adult</strong> or
<strong>ancient</strong>) copper dragon can use one or both of the
following additional lair actions while in its lair:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Laughing Gas</strong> The dragon chooses a point on the
ground that it can see within 120 feet of it. A cloud of pink gas fills
a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that
area that fails a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw is incapacitated with
laughter until the end of its next turn.</li>
<li><strong>Torpid Energy</strong> The dragon chooses a creature it can
see within 120 feet of it. If the target fails a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw, its speed is halved, and it can't use reactions or bonus
actions until the end of its next turn.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="regional-effects">Regional Effects</h4>
<p>The region containing a legendary copper dragon's lair is warped by
the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic carvings of the dragon's smiling visage can be seen worked
into stone terrain and objects within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.</li>
<li>Tiny beasts such as rodents and birds that are normally unable to
speak gain the magical ability to speak and understand Draconic while
within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. These creatures speak well of the
dragon, but can't divulge its whereabouts.</li>
<li>Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair are prone
to fits of giggling. Even serious matters suddenly seem amusing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the dragon dies, the magic carvings fade over the course of 1d10
days. The other effects end immediately.</p>
<p><strong><em>Additional Regional Effects.</em></strong> Either of
these effects might appear in the area around a copper dragon's lair, in
addition to or instead of the effects described in the <em>Monster
Manual</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distant Melodies</strong> The ethereal music of woodwinds
and bells can be heard carried on the wind within 1 mile of the dragon's
lair.</li>
<li><strong>Starlit Stones</strong> Standing stones are common on
hilltops within 1 mile of the dragon's lair. The stones shed dim light
in a 10-foot radius at night. (If the dragon dies, the stones remain,
but they no longer shed light.)</li>
</ul>
