objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force
damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Sensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight,
the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Life Drain.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em>
+6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 21 (4d8 + 3)
necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving
throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the
damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long
rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to
0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Create Specter.</em></strong> The wraith targets a
humanoid within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1
minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a
<strong>specter</strong> in the space of its corpse or in the nearest
unoccupied space. The <strong>specter</strong> is under the wraith's
control. The wraith can have no more than seven specters under its
control at one time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="wraith-1">Wraith</h2>
<p>A wraith is malice incarnate, concentrated into an incorporeal form
that seeks to quench all life. The creature is suffused with negative
energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves nearby plants
blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires
can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith's horrifying
existence.</p>
<p><strong><em>Vile Oblivion.</em></strong> When a mortal humanoid lives
a debased life or enters into a fiendish pact, it consigns its soul to
eternal damnation in the Lower Planes. However, sometimes the soul
becomes so suffused with negative energy that it collapses in on itself
and ceases to exist the instant before it can shuffle off to some
horrible afterlife. When this occurs, the spirit becomes a soulless
wraith-a malevolent void trapped on the plane where it died. Almost
nothing of the wraith's former existence is preserved; in this new form,
it exists only to annihilate other life.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bereft of Body.</em></strong> A wraith can move through
solid creatures and objects as easily as a mortal creature moves through
fog.</p>
<p>A wraith might retain a few memories of its mortal life as shadowy
echoes. However, even the strongest events and emotions become little
more than faint impressions, fleeting as half-remembered dreams. A
wraith might pause to stare at something that fascinated it in life, or
it might curb its wrath in acknowledgment of a past friendship. Such
moments come rarely, however, because most wraiths despise what they
were as a reminder of what they have become.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Commanders.</em></strong> A wraith can make an
undead servant from the spirit of a humanoid creature that has recently
suffered a violent death. Such a fragment of woe becomes a specter,
spiteful of all that lives.</p>
<p>Wraiths sometimes rule the legions of the dead, plotting the doom of
living creatures. When they emerge from their tombs to do battle, life
and hope shrivel before them. Even if a wraith's armies are forced to
retreat, the lands its forces occupied are so blasted and withered that
those who live there often starve and die.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A wraith doesn't require
air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
