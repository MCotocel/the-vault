<strong><em>Shapechanger.</em></strong> The fiend can use its action to
polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form.
Without wings, the fiend loses its flying speed. Other than its size and
speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is
wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it
dies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Telepathic Bond.</em></strong> The fiend ignores the
range restriction on its telepathy when communicating with a creature it
has charmed. The two don't even need to be on the same plane of
existence.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Claw (Fiend Form Only).</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon
Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 +
3) slashing damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Charm.</em></strong> One humanoid the fiend can see
within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be
magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the fiend's verbal
or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a
suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a
success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the
effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend's Charm for the
next 24 hours. The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If
it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.</p>
<p><strong><em>Draining Kiss.</em></strong> The fiend kisses a creature
charmed by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5)
psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the
damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long
rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to
0.</p>
<p><strong><em>Etherealness.</em></strong> The fiend magically enters
the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="succubus-1">Succubus</h2>
<p>Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the
lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons,
night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells,
uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord
Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.</p>
<p>Though legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an
incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for
one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in
its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in
veiled, insidious ways.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beautiful Corrupters.</em></strong> A succubus or incubus
first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to
lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures.
Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires,
indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the
victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more
susceptible to temptation in everyday life.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to
directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a
humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the
succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its
desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.</p>
<p>A mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or
contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature
completely-some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals
of thought, word, and deed-the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The
more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the
more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the
succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the
Lower Planes.</p>
<p>The succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only
when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A charmed creature
isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its
will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's
soul.</p>
<p><strong><em>Deadly Kiss.</em></strong> The kiss of a succubus or
incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a
corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no
satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness
that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually
delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fiendish Offspring.</em></strong> Succubi and incubi can
reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a
succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union,
a <strong>cambion</strong> child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish
offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.</p>
