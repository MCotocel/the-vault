<p><em>Large construct, unaligned</em> <strong><em> - <strong>Armor

(14d10 + 56) - <strong>Speed</strong> 20 ft. </em></strong>
|STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA| |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| |20

slashing from nonmagical attacks that aren't adamantine -
<strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, exhaustion, frightened,
paralyzed, petrified, poisoned - <strong>Senses</strong> darkvision 60
ft., passive Perception 9 - <strong>Languages</strong> understands the
languages of its creator but can't speak - <strong>Challenge</strong> 9
(5,000 XP) - <strong>Proficiency Bonus</strong> +4 </em></strong>
<strong><em>Acid Absorption.</em></strong> Whenever the golem is
subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a
number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.</p>
<p><strong><em>Berserk.</em></strong> Whenever the golem starts its turn
with 60 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk.
On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest
creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and
attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object
smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so
until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.</p>
<p><strong><em>Immutable Form.</em></strong> The golem is immune to any
spell or effect that would alter its form.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The golem has advantage
on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Weapons.</em></strong> The golem's weapon attacks
are magical.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The golem makes two slam
attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +8 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning
damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an
amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces
its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the
<em>greater restoration</em> spell or other magic.</p>
<p><strong><em>Haste (Recharge 5â€“6).</em></strong> Until the end of its
next turn, the golem magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage
on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus
action.</p>

<h2 id="clay-golem-1">Clay Golem</h2>
<p>Sculpted from clay, this bulky golem stands head and shoulders taller
than most human-sized creatures. It is human shaped, but its proportions
are off.</p>
<p>Clay golems are often divinely endowed with purpose by priests of
great faith. However, clay is a weak vessel for life force. If the golem
is damaged, the elemental spirit bound into it can break free. Such a
golem runs amok, smashing everything around it until it is destroyed or
completely repaired.</p>
<p><strong><em>Golems.</em></strong> Golems are made from humble
materials-clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone-but they possess
astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no
sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable
juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator's orders, and it protects or
attacks as that creator demands.</p>
<p>To create a golem, one requires a manual of golems (see the Dungeon
Master's Guide). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a
manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.</p>
<p><strong><em>Elemental Spirit in Material Form.</em></strong> The
construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring
great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or
surgery. Sometimes a golem's creator is the master of the art, but often
the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the
work.</p>
<p>After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the
golem's creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of
Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history.
It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit
to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem's
creator.</p>
<p>A golem can be created with a special amulet or other item that
allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose
creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.</p>
<p>A golem can't think or act for itself. Though it understands its
commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that
understanding, and can't be reasoned with or tricked with words.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ageless Guardians.</em></strong> Golems can guard sacred
sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their
creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while
brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent
spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>Blind Obedience.</em></strong> When its creator or
possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the
golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to
follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can't fulfill
its orders, a golem might react violently-or stand and do nothing. A
golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates
between them.</p>
<p><strong><em>Constructed Nature.</em></strong> A golem doesn't require
air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
