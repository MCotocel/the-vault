<h2 id="half-ogre-ogrillon-1">Half-Ogre (Ogrillon)</h2>
<p>When an ogre mates with a human, hobgoblin, bugbear, or orc, the
result is always a half-ogre. (Ogres don't mate with dwarves, halflings,
or elves. They eat them.) Human mothers rarely survive the birth of a
half-ogre offspring.</p>
<p>The half-ogre offspring of an ogre and an orc is also called an
ogrillon. An adult half-ogre or ogrillon stands 8 feet tall and weighs
450 pounds on average.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ogres.</em></strong> Ogres are as lazy of mind as they
are strong of body. They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for
food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10
feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.</p>
<p><strong><em>Furious Tempers.</em></strong> Ogres are notorious for
their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense.
Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre's wrath in an instant-as can
stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making
faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited,
an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects
or creatures to smash.</p>
<p>An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a
cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and
lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from
its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre
has depleted an area of food does it move on.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey
on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with
goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the
giants' complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank
beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly
anything a giant asks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gruesome Gluttons.</em></strong> Ogres eat almost
anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and
elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing
scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim
remains after the ogre has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from
its quarry's skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre
crafting is the height of ogre culture.</p>
<p><strong><em>Greedy Collectors.</em></strong> An ogre's eyes glitter
with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough
sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous "treasure" taken
from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets,
a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a
cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the
gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small
handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's trust by
offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legendary Stupidity.</em></strong> Few ogres can count to
ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a
rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres
believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they
break things they don't understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test
their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent
words-and then being eaten in turn.</p>
<p><strong><em>Primitive Wanderers.</em></strong> Ogres clothe
themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and
weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they
establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands,
taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and
unwary farmers.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ogre Gangs.</em></strong> Ogres sometimes band together
in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When
bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the
other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as
likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is
temporarily flush with food and weapons.</p>
