<p><em>Large ooze, unaligned</em> <strong><em> - <strong>Armor

The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without
squeezing.</p>
<p><strong><em>Corrosive Form.</em></strong> A creature that touches the
pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4
(1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits
the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent
and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5,
the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood
that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage. The pudding can
eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spider Climb.</em></strong> The pudding can climb
difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing
to make an ability check.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Pseudopod.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning
damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage. In addition, nonmagical armor worn by
the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative −1
penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty
reduces its AC to 10.</p>
<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Split.</em></strong> When a pudding that is Medium or
larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two
new puddings if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new pudding has hit
points equal to half the original pudding's, rounded down. New puddings
are one size smaller than the original pudding.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="black-pudding-1">Black Pudding</h2>
<p>A black pudding resembles a heaving mound of sticky black sludge. In
dim passageways, the pudding appears to be little more than a blot of
shadow.</p>
<p>Flesh, wood, metal, and bone dissolve when the pudding ebbs over
them. Stone remains behind, wiped clean.</p>
<p><strong><em>Oozes.</em></strong> Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning
areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the
damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be
dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings,
spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through
cracks.</p>
<p>The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is
often the searing pain of its acidic touch. Oozes are drawn to movement
and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce
they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an
immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs
nearby.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slow Death.</em></strong> An ooze kills its prey slowly.
Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf
creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is
that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too
late.</p>
<p>Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have
coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their
quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its
killers.</p>
<p>Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few
beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of
intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or
self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating
without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of
sentience and malevolent intent.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unwitting Servants.</em></strong> Although an ooze lacks
the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that
understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it
can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend
passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a
pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from
coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers
in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel
or room.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spawn of Juiblex.</em></strong> According to the
Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments
or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ooze Nature.</em></strong> An ooze doesn't require
sleep.</p>
