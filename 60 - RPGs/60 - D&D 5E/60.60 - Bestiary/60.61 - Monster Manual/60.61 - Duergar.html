the duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).</em></strong> For 1 minute, the duergar magically increases in
size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the
duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon
attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and
Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar lacks the room to
become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space
available.</p>
<p><strong><em>War Pick.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing

<p><strong><em>Javelin.</em></strong> <em>Melee or Ranged Weapon
Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target.
<em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing
damage while enlarged.</p>
<p><strong><em>Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).</em></strong> The duergar magically turns invisible until it
attacks, casts a spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until its concentration
is broken, up to 1 hour (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment
the duergar wears or carries is invisible with it.</p>

<h2 id="duergar-1">Duergar</h2>
<p>The tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in
fantastic cities deep in the Underdark. Using ancient dwarven knowledge
and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean
kingdoms.</p>
<p>Most duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin.
They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with
simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slaves to Slavers.</em></strong> The duergar were once
dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth
brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for
generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their
independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever
changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as
evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom,
duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and
complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their
craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth
or artistry.</p>
<p>Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean
races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those
alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves
to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude
currency.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tough as Stone.</em></strong> Like dwarves, duergar have
strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible
mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A
duergar's mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and
other spells.</p>
<p><strong><em>Born of Darkness.</em></strong> The Underdark is
saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over
generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and
strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it
faces a foe it can't fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its
territory, it can just as easily become invisible to slip away into the
darkness. Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their darkvision,
allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight
comes at a cost, however, as a duergar's vision is compromised by
sunlight.</p>
<p><strong><em>Infernal Master.</em></strong> Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine
Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate
the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them
divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on
toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true
identity.</p>
