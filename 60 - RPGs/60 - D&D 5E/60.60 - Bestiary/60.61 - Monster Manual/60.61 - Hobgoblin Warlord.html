melee attacks. Alternatively, it can make two ranged attacks with its
javelins.</p>
<p><strong><em>Longsword.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9

30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can
add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin.
A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This
effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated.</p>
<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Parry.</em></strong> The hobgoblin adds 3 to its AC
against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the hobgoblin must
see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="hobgoblin-warlord-1">Hobgoblin Warlord</h2>
<p>War horns sound, stones fly from catapults, and the thunder of a
thousand booted feet echoes across the land as hobgoblins march to
battle. Across the borderlands of civilization, settlements and settlers
must contend with these aggressive humanoids, whose thirst for conquest
is never satisfied.</p>
<p>Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from
dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath
their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed
teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which
symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as
long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few
do.</p>
<p><strong><em>Goblinoids.</em></strong> Hobgoblins belong to a family
of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their
cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.</p>
<p><strong><em>Martial Might.</em></strong> A hobgoblin measures virtue
by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except
the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins
of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those
positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.</p>
<p>Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great
skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military
devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their
weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors
associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms
with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.</p>
<p><strong><em>Military Legions.</em></strong> Hobgoblins organize
themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society,
every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to
the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves
driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a
warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin
warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory,
glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.</p>
<p>As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival
legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between
legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only
exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the
battlefield.</p>
<p><strong><em>Strategic Thinkers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a
strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated
battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader.
However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other
opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.</p>
<p>Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more
expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans,
ogres, and giants.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beast Trainers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a long
history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races,
they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long
distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and
keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps.
Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that
goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting
beasts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conquer and Control.</em></strong> Hobgoblins claim lands
with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains,
near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal,
and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in
strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging
areas to expand their territory.</p>
<p>Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don't take up arms
lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance
to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a
stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply
lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.</p>
<p>Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses
with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes,
dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with
ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or
ballistas.</p>
<p><strong><em>Legion of Maglubiyet.</em></strong> Hobgoblins worship
Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying
as this figure is, hobgoblins don't fear death, believing that when they
die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet's army
on the plane of Acheron.</p>
