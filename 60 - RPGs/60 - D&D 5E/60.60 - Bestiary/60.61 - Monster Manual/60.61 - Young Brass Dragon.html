<p><strong><em>Bite.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to

<p><strong><em>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5â€“6).</em></strong> The dragon
uses one of the following breath weapons. - <strong>Fire Breath</strong>
The dragon exhales fire in a 40-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each
creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking
42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. - <strong>Sleep Breath</strong> The dragon exhales sleep
gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC
14 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 5 minutes. This
effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses
an action to wake it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="young-brass-dragon-1">Young Brass Dragon</h2>
<p>The most gregarious of the true dragons, brass dragons crave
conversation, sunlight, and hot, dry climates.</p>
<p>A brass dragon's head is defined by the broad protective plate that
expands from its forehead and the spikes protruding from its chin. A
frill runs the length of its neck, and its tapering wings extend down
the length of its tail. A brass dragon wyrmling's scales are a dull,
mottled brown. As it ages, the dragon's scales begin to shine,
eventually taking on a warm, burnished luster. Its wings and frills are
mottled green toward the edges, darkening with age. As a brass dragon
grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal
orbs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Boldly Talkative.</em></strong> A brass dragon engages in
conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life,
accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of
treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon's
presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it. If the
creature attempts to escape by magic or force, the dragon might respond
with a fit of pique, using its sleep gas to incapacitate the creature.
When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant
claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for
small talk is slaked.</p>
<p>A brass dragon is trusting of creatures that appear to enjoy
conversation as much as it does, but is smart enough to know when it is
being manipulated. When that happens, the dragon often responds in kind,
treating a bout of mutual trickery as a game.</p>
<p><strong><em>Prized Treasures.</em></strong> Brass dragons covet magic
items that allow them to converse with interesting personalities. An
intelligent telepathic weapon or a magic lamp with a djinni bound inside
it are among the greatest treasures a brass dragon can possess.</p>
<p>Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret
places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering
where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps.
Adventurers and wanderers should be wary if they happen across a chest
hidden in an oasis or a treasure cache tucked away in a half-buried
desert ruin, for these might be parts of a brass dragon's hoard.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Brass Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> A brass dragon's
desert lair is typically a ruin, canyon, or cave network with ceiling
holes to allow for sunlight.</p>
<h3 id="metallic-dragons">Metallic Dragons</h3>
<p>Metallic dragons seek to preserve and protect, viewing themselves as
one powerful race among the many races that have a place in the
world.</p>
<h4 id="noble-curiosity">Noble Curiosity</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but
they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather,
metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed
relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure
hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history,
and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other
creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even
evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's
hoard.</p>
<p>A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard
for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to
the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view. A metallic
dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.</p>
<h4 id="solitary-shapeshifters">Solitary Shapeshifters</h4>
<p>At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical
ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon
learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures
for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their
lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city
streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and
amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.</p>
<p>Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as
possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are
often far out of touch with current events.</p>
<h4 id="the-persistence-of-memory">The Persistence of Memory</h4>
<p>Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of
humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons
can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person
they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with
over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a
cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart
as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might
resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the
dragon's hoard three centuries before.</p>
<h4 id="king-of-good-dragons">King of Good Dragons</h4>
<p>The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum
Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often
wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human
male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven
golden canaries-actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed
form.</p>
<p>Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though
he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon
Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes
worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a
lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>
