Sight.</em></strong> The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane
when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong><em>Incorporeal Movement.</em></strong> The ghost can move
through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain.
It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Withering Touch.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon
Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (4d6 +
3) necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Etherealness.</em></strong> The ghost enters the Ethereal
Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the
Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet
it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.</p>
<p><strong><em>Horrifying Visage.</em></strong> Each non-undead creature
within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13
Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by
5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 Ã— 10 years. A frightened target can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw
is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this
ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be
reversed with a <em>greater restoration</em> spell, but only within 24
hours of it occurring.</p>
<p><strong><em>Possession (Recharge 6).</em></strong> One humanoid that
the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma
saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears,
and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost
now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The
ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except
ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It
otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain
access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The
possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it
as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect
like the <em>dispel evil and good</em> spell. When the possession ends,
the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.
The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after
succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.</p>

<h2 id="ghost-1">Ghost</h2>
<p>A ghost is the soul of a once-living creature, bound to haunt a
specific location, creature, or object that held significance to it in
its life.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unfinished Business.</em></strong> A ghost yearns to
complete some unresolved task from its life. It might seek to avenge its
own death, fulfill an oath, or relay a message to a loved one. A ghost
might not realize that it has died and continue the everyday routine of
its life. Others are driven by wickedness or spite, as with a ghost that
refuses to rest until every member of a certain family or organization
is dead.</p>
<p>The surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished
business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness
tied to its former life. The ghost of a person tortured to death might
be killed again by the implements of that torture. The ghost of a
gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral
fragrance.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ghostly Manifestations.</em></strong> Sensations of
profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from
places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural
silences create an unsettling atmosphere. Cold spots settle in rooms
that have roaring fires. A choking stench might seep into the area,
inanimate objects might move of their own accord, and corpses might rise
from the grave. The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they
simply occur.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A ghost doesn't require air,
food, drink, or sleep.</p>
