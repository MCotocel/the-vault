The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic

<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The drow's
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11). It can innately
cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>
<p>At will: <em>dancing lights</em> 1/day each: <em>darkness</em>,
<em>faerie fire</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Sensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight,
the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Shortsword.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em>
+4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing

<p><strong><em>Hand Crossbow.</em></strong> <em>Ranged Weapon
Attack:</em> +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5
(1d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw
fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in
this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature
takes an action to shake it awake.</p>

<h2 id="drow-1">Drow</h2>
<h1 id="drow-2">Drow</h1>
<p>Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves were divided, with those of
benevolent disposition battling those that were selfish and cruel. The
war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent
kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and
endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found
refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not
forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the
underworld.</p>
<p><strong><em>Children of Lolth.</em></strong> The drow worship Lolth,
a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon
Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have
built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow
do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world.
Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer
see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness,
and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their
surface-dwelling kin, they will.</p>
<p><strong><em>Creatures of Darkness.</em></strong> The drow have lived
underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and
can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When
slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding
parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness,
bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission.
Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in
their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.</p>
<p><strong><em>Underdark Cities.</em></strong> The dark elves build
fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant.
Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf
artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic.
Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and
remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites
and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and
ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls.
Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under
watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect
their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in
beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies
that would otherwise soar over the walls.</p>
<p><strong><em>Drow Magic.</em></strong> Just as the drow have adapted
to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that
magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons,
create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow
spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their
magic in the most abhorrent ways.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arms and Armor.</em></strong> Drow craft weapons made of
adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn
their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and
mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness.
However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow
weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical
properties when brought to the surface.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cutthroat Politics.</em></strong> Drow politics are
cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is
typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and
such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.</p>
<p>Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who
seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others.
Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the
middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn
fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of
a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low
birth and the occasional non-drow captive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Matriarchal Rule.</em></strong> Lolth, through her
faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that
her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to
manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that
disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her
priestesses command.</p>
<p>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might
lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he
reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her
hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any
function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a
house.</p>
<p><strong><em>Poison Predilection.</em></strong> Distilled from spider
venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance
among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and
politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies
unconscious. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with
this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that
follows combat.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="variant-drow-magic-armor-and-weapons">Variant: Drow Magic Armor
and Weapons</h5>
<p>Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their
enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1
hour or longer.</p>
<ul>
<li>A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC
16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword
attacks.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A drow elite warrior wearing +2 studded leather and carrying a +2
shortsword has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with
shortsword attacks.</li>
<li>A drow priestess of Lolth wearing +3 scale mail has AC 19.</li>
</ul>
