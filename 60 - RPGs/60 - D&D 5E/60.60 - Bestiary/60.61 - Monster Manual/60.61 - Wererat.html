<h2 id="wererat-1">Wererat</h2>
<p>Wererats are cunning lycanthropes with sly, avaricious personalities.
They are wiry and twitchy in humanoid form, with thin hair and darting
eyes. In their humanoid and hybrid forms, wererats prefer light weapons
and use ambush tactics rather than fighting as a pack. Although a
wererat can deliver a nasty bite in its rat form, it favors that form
for stealthy infiltration and escape rather than combat.</p>
<p>A wererat clan operates much like a thieves' guild, with wererats
transmitting their curse only to creatures they want to induct into the
clan. Wererats that are accidentally cursed or break loose from the
clan's control are quickly hunted down and killed.</p>
<p>Wererat clans are found throughout urban civilization, often dwelling
in cellars and catacombs. These creatures are common in the sewers
beneath major cities, viewing those subterranean areas as their hunting
grounds. Rats and giant rats are commonly found living among
wererats.</p>
<h1 id="lycanthropes">Lycanthropes</h1>
<p>One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can
transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its
natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its
normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features
suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope
resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection,
its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red
in the dark.</p>
<p>Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at
night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good
lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized
creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and
towns.</p>
<h4 id="curse-of-lycanthropy">Curse of Lycanthropy</h4>
<p>A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy
after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents
are lycanthropes. A <em>remove curse</em> spell can rid an afflicted
lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of
the curse only with a wish.</p>
<p>A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting
the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality
while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep
the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises,
the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into
its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and
humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled
once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its
condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation,
though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p>
<p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept
what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their
shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will.
Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to
bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the
weak.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="player-characters-as-lycanthropes">Player Characters as
Lycanthropes</h5>
<p>A character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics
except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the
lycanthrope's speeds in non-humanoid form, damage immunities, traits,
and actions that don't involve equipment. The character is proficient
with the lycanthrope's natural attacks, such as its bite or claws, which
deal damage as shown in the lycanthrope's statistics. The character
can't speak while in animal form.</p>
<p>A non-lycanthrope humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of
lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the
lycanthrope's proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope's Constitution
modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse, his or her
alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to
decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control
until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.</p>
<p>The following information applies to specific lycanthropes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Werebear.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of
19 if his or her score isn't already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while
in bear or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for
the natural weapons are based on Strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Wereboar.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of
17 if his or her score isn't already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while
in boar or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for
the tusks are based on Strength. For the Charge trait, the DC is 8 + the
character's proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Wererat.</em></strong> The character gains a Dexterity of
15 if his or her score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls for
the bite are based on whichever is higher of the character's Strength
and Dexterity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Weretiger.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength
of 17 if his or her score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls
for the natural weapons are based on Strength. For the Pounce trait, the
DC is 8 + the character's proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Werewolf.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of
15 if his or her score isn't already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while
in wolf or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for
the natural weapons are based on Strength.</p>
