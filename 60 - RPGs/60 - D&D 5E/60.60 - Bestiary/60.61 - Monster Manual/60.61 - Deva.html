<strong>Languages</strong> all, telepathy 120 ft. -
<strong>Challenge</strong> 10 (5,900 XP) - <strong>Proficiency
Bonus</strong> +4 </em></strong> <strong><em>Angelic
Weapons.</em></strong> The deva's weapon attacks are magical. When the
deva hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 radiant damage
(included in the attack).</p>
<p><strong><em>Innate Spellcasting.</em></strong> The deva's
spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). The deva can
innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal
components:</p>
<p>At will: <em>detect evil and good</em> 1/day each: <em>commune</em>,
<em>raise dead</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The deva has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The deva makes two melee
attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mace.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +8 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning
damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Healing Touch (3/Day).</em></strong> The deva touches
another creature. The target magically regains 20 (4d8 + 2) hit points
and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or
deafness.</p>
<p><strong><em>Change Shape.</em></strong> The deva magically polymorphs
into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less
than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if
it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by
the new form (the deva's choice). In a new form, the deva retains its
game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes,
Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new
form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class
features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but
that it lacks.</p>

<h2 id="deva-1">Deva</h2>
<p>An angel is a celestial agent sent forth into the planes to further
its god's agenda for weal or woe. Its sublime beauty and presence can
drive awestruck onlookers to their knees. Yet angels are destroyers too,
and their appearance portends doom as often as it signals hope.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shards of the Divine.</em></strong> Angels are formed
from the astral essence of benevolent gods and are thus divine beings of
great power and foresight.</p>
<p>Angels act out the will of their gods with tireless devotion. Even
chaotic good deities command lawful good angels, knowing that the
angels' dedication to order best allows them to fulfill divine commands.
An angel follows a single driving purpose, as decreed by its deity.
However, an angel is incapable of following commands that stray from the
path of law and good.</p>
<p>An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of
law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This
quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that
comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of
another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel
is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods
of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to
the most dire circumstances.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fallen Angels.</em></strong> An angel's moral compass
grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing.
Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but
sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional
or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as
an outcast. Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection
to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their
banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by
seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other
fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the
first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel,
some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the
Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits. If they are
redeemed, they can become powerful allies dedicated to justice and
compassionate service.</p>
<p><strong><em>Immortal Nature.</em></strong> An angel doesn't require
food, drink, or sleep.</p>
<p><strong><em>Deva.</em></strong> Devas are angels that act as divine
messengers or agents to the Material Plane, the Shadowfell, and the
Feywild and that can assume a form appropriate to the realm they are
sent to.</p>
<p>Legend tells of angels that take mortal form for years, lending aid,
hope, and courage to goodhearted folk. A deva can take any shape,
although it prefers to appear to mortals as an innocuous humanoid or
animal. When circumstances require that it cast off its guise, a deva is
a beautiful humanoid-like creature with silvery skin. Its hair and eyes
gleam with an unearthly luster, and large feathery wings unfurl from its
shoulder blades.</p>
