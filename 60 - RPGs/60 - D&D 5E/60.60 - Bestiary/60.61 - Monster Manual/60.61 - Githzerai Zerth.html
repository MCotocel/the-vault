</blockquote>
<h2 id="githzerai-zerth-1">Githzerai Zerth</h2>
<p>Focused philosophers and austere ascetics, the githzerai pursue lives
of rigid order. Lean and muscular, they wear unadorned clothing free of
ornamentation, keeping their own counsel and trusting few creatures
outside of their own kind. Having turned their backs on their warlike
githyanki kin, the githzerai maintain a strict monastic lifestyle,
dwelling on islands of order in the vast sea of chaos that is the plane
of Limbo.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psionic Adepts.</em></strong> The progenitors of the
githzerai adapted to-and were transformed by-the psychic environment
imposed on them by their illithid overlords. Under the teachings of
Zerthimon, who called on his people to abandon the warlike ambitions of
Gith, the githzerai focused their mental energy on creating physical and
psychic barriers to protect them from attack, psychic or otherwise.
Fighting is personal to a githzerai, which uses its mind to daze and
incapacitate opponents, leaving them vulnerable to physical
punishment.</p>
<p><strong><em>Order amid Chaos.</em></strong> The githzerai willingly
dwell in the heart of utter chaos in Limbo-a twisting, mercurial plane
prone to manipulation and subjugation by githzerai minds strong enough
to master it. Limbo is a maelstrom of primal matter and energy, its
terrain a storm of rock and earth swept up in torrents of murky liquid,
buffeted by strong winds, blasted by fire, and chilled by crushing walls
of ice.</p>
<p>The forces of Limbo react to sentience, however. Using the power of
their minds, the githzerai tame the plane's chaotic elements, causing
them to settle into fixed and survivable forms and creating oases and
sanctuaries within the maelstrom.</p>
<p>Githzerai fortress-monasteries stand resolute against the chaos that
surrounds them, virtually impervious to the turmoil of their
surroundings, because the githzerai will it. Each monastery is overseen
by monks that impose a strict schedule of chants, meals, martial arts
training, and devotions according to their own philosophy. Behind their
psionically fortified walls, the githzerai embrace thought, learning,
psionic power, order, and discipline above all other things.</p>
<p>The social hierarchy of the githzerai is based on merit, and those
githzerai who are the wisest teachers and the most skilled at physical
and mental combat become leaders. The githzerai revere great heroes and
teachers of the past, emulating those figures' virtues in their everyday
lives.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disciples of Zerthimon.</em></strong> Githzerai revere
Zerthimon, the founder of their race. Although Gith won their people's
freedom, Zerthimon saw her as unfit to lead. He believed that her
warmongering would soon make her a tyrant no better than the mind
flayers.</p>
<p>Skilled githzerai monks that best exemplify the teachings and
principles of Zerthimon are called zerths.</p>
<p>These powerful and disciplined monks can shift their bodies from one
plane to another using only the power of their minds.</p>
<p><strong><em>Beyond Limbo.</em></strong> Though githzerai rarely deal
with the realms beyond Limbo, advanced monks of other races sometimes
seek out a githzerai monastery and attempt to gain admittance as
students. More rarely, a githzerai master establishes a hidden monastery
on the Material Plane to train young githzerai or to spread the
philosophy and teachings of Zerthimon.</p>
<p>As disciplined as they are, the githzerai have never forgotten their
long imprisonment by the mind flayers.</p>
<p>As a special devotion, they organize a rrakkma-an illithid hunting
party-to other planes, not returning to their monasteries until they
slay at least as many illithids as there are hunters in the party.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gith.</em></strong> The warlike githyanki and the
contemplative githzerai are a sundered people-two cultures that utterly
despise one another. Before there were githyanki or githzerai, these
creatures were a single race enslaved by the mind flayers. Although they
attempted to overthrow their masters many times, their rebellions were
repeatedly crushed until a great leader named Gith arose.</p>
<p>After much bloodshed, Gith and her followers threw off the yoke of
their illithid masters, but another leader named Zerthimon emerged in
the aftermath of battle.</p>
<p>Zerthimon challenged Gith's motives, claiming that her strict martial
leadership and desire for vengeance amounted to little more than another
form of slavery for her people. A rift erupted between followers of each
leader, and they eventually became the two races whose enmity endures to
this day.</p>
<p>Whether these tall, gaunt creatures were peaceful or savage, cultured
or primitive before the mind flayers enslaved and changed them, none can
say. Not even the original name of their race remains from that distant
time.</p>
