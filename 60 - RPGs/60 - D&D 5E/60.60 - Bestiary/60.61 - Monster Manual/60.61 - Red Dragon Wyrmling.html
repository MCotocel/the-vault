</blockquote>
<h2 id="red-dragon-wyrmling-1">Red Dragon Wyrmling</h2>
<p>The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to
increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for
dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their
disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a
red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its
silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes
dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any
chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge
that resembles metal burned blue by fire.</p>
<p>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet,
turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as
the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red
dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.</p>
<p><strong><em>Mountain Masters.</em></strong> Red dragons prefer
mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch
high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them
into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to
time.</p>
<p><strong><em>Arrogant Tyrants.</em></strong> Red dragons fly into
destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious
and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by
many cultures.</p>
<p>No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These
creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of
dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule
in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as
theirs to command.</p>
<p><strong><em>Status and Slaves.</em></strong> Red dragons are fiercely
territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events
in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants,
messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red
dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.</p>
<p>When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic
evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's
leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red
dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for
displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature
in an attempt to stay alive.</p>
<p><strong><em>Obsessive Collectors.</em></strong> Red dragons value
wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They
covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a
bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special
affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain,
exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.</p>
<p>A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its
hoard, along with each item's exact location. It might notice the
absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays
the thief without mercy. If the thief can't be found, the dragon goes on
a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its
wrath.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Red Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> Red dragons lair in
high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or
within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves
with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red
dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing
heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard
well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its
time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights
of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it
controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.</p>
<p>Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's
power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and
the nations it has conquered.</p>
<h3 id="chromatic-dragons">Chromatic Dragons</h3>
<p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil
side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons
are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including
each other.</p>
<h4 id="driven-by-greed">Driven by Greed</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their
every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to
them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard
for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its
piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the
stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in
commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
<h4 id="creatures-of-ego">Creatures of Ego</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing
themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When
they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own
interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief
is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and
worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to
convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are
animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy
of respect.</p>
<h4 id="dangerous-lairs">Dangerous Lairs</h4>
<p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its
treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe
environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter
but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for
its hoard.</p>
<p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote
locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching
them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a
red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to
the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use
magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their
treasures.</p>
<h4 id="queen-of-evil-dragons">Queen of Evil Dragons</h4>
<p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She
dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god,
Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is
loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons,
believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers
and hers alone.</p>
<p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the
chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white.
She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies
with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her
fearsome claws.</p>
<p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom
she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special
enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus
and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>
