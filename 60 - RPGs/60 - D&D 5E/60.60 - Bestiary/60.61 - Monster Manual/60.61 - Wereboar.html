(natural armor) in boar or hybrid form - <strong>Hit Points</strong> 78
(12d8 + 24) - <strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft. (40 ft. in boar form)

<strong>Languages</strong> Common (can't speak in boar form) -
<strong>Challenge</strong> 4 (1,100 XP) - <strong>Proficiency

The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into a boar-humanoid hybrid
or into a boar, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its
statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment
it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form
if it dies.</p>
<p><strong><em>Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).</em></strong> If the wereboar takes 14 damage or less that would
reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Charge (Boar or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> If the
wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits
it with its tusks on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6)
slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13
Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong>
The wereboar makes two attacks, only one of which can be with its
tusks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Maul (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong>
<em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
<em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tusks (Boar or Hybrid Form Only).</em></strong> <em>Melee
Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10
(2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed
on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wereboar
lycanthropy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="wereboar-1">Wereboar</h2>
<p>Wereboars are ill-tempered and vulgar brutes. As humanoids, they are
stocky and muscular, with short, stiff hair. In their humanoid and
hybrid forms, they use heavy weapons, while in hybrid or animal form,
they gain a devastating goring attack through which their curse is
spread. A wereboar infects other creatures indiscriminately, relishing
the fact that the more its victims resist the curse, the more savage and
bestial they become.</p>
<p>Wereboars live in small family groups in remote forest areas,
building ramshackle huts or dwelling in caves. They are suspicious of
strangers but sometimes ally themselves with orcs.</p>
<h1 id="lycanthropes">Lycanthropes</h1>
<p>One of the most ancient and feared of all curses, lycanthropy can
transform the most civilized humanoid into a ravening beast. In its
natural humanoid form, a creature cursed by lycanthropy appears as its
normal self. Over time, however, many lycanthropes acquire features
suggestive of their animal form. In that animal form, a lycanthrope
resembles a powerful version of a normal animal. On close inspection,
its eyes show a faint spark of unnatural intelligence and might glow red
in the dark.</p>
<p>Evil lycanthropes hide among normal folk, emerging in animal form at
night to spread terror and bloodshed, especially under a full moon. Good
lycanthropes are reclusive and uncomfortable around other civilized
creatures, often living alone in wilderness areas far from villages and
towns.</p>
<h4 id="curse-of-lycanthropy">Curse of Lycanthropy</h4>
<p>A humanoid creature can be afflicted with the curse of lycanthropy
after being wounded by a lycanthrope, or if one or both of its parents
are lycanthropes. A <em>remove curse</em> spell can rid an afflicted
lycanthrope of the curse, but a natural born lycanthrope can be freed of
the curse only with a wish.</p>
<p>A lycanthrope can either resist its curse or embrace it. By resisting
the curse, a lycanthrope retains its normal alignment and personality
while in humanoid form. It lives its life as it always has, burying deep
the bestial urges raging inside it. However, when the full moon rises,
the curse becomes too strong to resist, transforming the individual into
its beast form-or into a horrible hybrid form that combines animal and
humanoid traits. When the moon wanes, the beast within can be controlled
once again. Especially if the cursed creature is unaware of its
condition, it might not remember the events of its transformation,
though those memories often haunt a lycanthrope as bloody dreams.</p>
<p>Some individuals see little point in fighting the curse and accept
what they are. With time and experience, they learn to master their
shapechanging ability and can assume beast form or hybrid form at will.
Most lycanthropes that embrace their bestial natures succumb to
bloodlust, becoming evil, opportunistic creatures that prey on the
weak.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="player-characters-as-lycanthropes">Player Characters as
Lycanthropes</h5>
<p>A character who becomes a lycanthrope retains his or her statistics
except as specified by lycanthrope type. The character gains the
lycanthrope's speeds in non-humanoid form, damage immunities, traits,
and actions that don't involve equipment. The character is proficient
with the lycanthrope's natural attacks, such as its bite or claws, which
deal damage as shown in the lycanthrope's statistics. The character
can't speak while in animal form.</p>
<p>A non-lycanthrope humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of
lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the
lycanthrope's proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope's Constitution
modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse, his or her
alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to
decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control
until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.</p>
<p>The following information applies to specific lycanthropes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Werebear.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of
19 if his or her score isn't already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while
in bear or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for
the natural weapons are based on Strength.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Wereboar.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of
17 if his or her score isn't already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while
in boar or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for
the tusks are based on Strength. For the Charge trait, the DC is 8 + the
character's proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Wererat.</em></strong> The character gains a Dexterity of
15 if his or her score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls for
the bite are based on whichever is higher of the character's Strength
and Dexterity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Weretiger.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength
of 17 if his or her score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls
for the natural weapons are based on Strength. For the Pounce trait, the
DC is 8 + the character's proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Werewolf.</em></strong> The character gains a Strength of
15 if his or her score isn't already higher, and a +1 bonus to AC while
in wolf or hybrid form (from natural armor). Attack and damage rolls for
the natural weapons are based on Strength.</p>
