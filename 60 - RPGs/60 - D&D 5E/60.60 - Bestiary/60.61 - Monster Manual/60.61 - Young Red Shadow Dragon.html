<h2 id="young-red-shadow-dragon-1">Young Red Shadow Dragon</h2>
<p>Shadow dragons are true dragons that were either born in the
Shadowfell or transformed by years spent within its dismal confines.
Some shadow dragons embrace the Shadowfell for its bleak landscapes and
desolation. Others seek to return to the Material Plane, hungry to
spread the darkness and evil of the Plane of Shadow.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dark Portals.</em></strong> Portals to the Shadowfell
manifest in forlorn places and the deep gloom of subterranean caverns.
The dragons that lair in such places often discover these portals and
find themselves transported to a new realm. Ancient dragons that sleep
in their lairs for months or years at a time might find themselves
spirited away, never knowing that a portal has formed without their
knowledge as they dream.</p>
<p><strong><em>Recast in Shadow.</em></strong> The transformation to a
shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a
dragon's scales lose their luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its
leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of
opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are
weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes the
dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self. The magical nature
of dragons holds an attraction for the Shadowfell, which seems somehow
to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The Shadowfell
also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a
creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise.
As months and years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes
aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do
nothing to prevent it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Back in the World.</em></strong> A shadow dragon is so
suffused with the power of the Shadowfell that even a return to the
Material Plane can't undo its transformation. Some shadow dragons
attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to the
Shadowfell to keep them company, at least until they tire of their
guests and devour them. Others are happy to leave the Shadowfell behind
forever, understanding that treasure and power are easier to come by in
the Material Plane.</p>
<h3 id="shadow-dragon-template">Shadow Dragon Template</h3>
<p>Only a true dragon can transform into a shadow dragon, and only if it
is born in the Shadowfell or remains there for several years. A
dracolich can't be turned into a shadow dragon, since it loses its
draconic nature when it becomes undead.</p>
<p>When a dragon becomes a shadow dragon, it retains its statistics
except as described below. The shadow dragon might retain or lose any or
all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.</p>
<p><strong><em>Damage Resistances.</em></strong> The dragon has
resistance to necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Skill Proficiency: Stealth.</em></strong> The dragon's
proficiency bonus is doubled for its Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Living Shadow.</em></strong> While in dim light or
darkness, the dragon has resistance to damage that isn't force, psychic,
or radiant.</p>
<p><strong><em>Shadow Stealth.</em></strong> While in dim light or
darkness, the dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sunlight Sensitivity.</em></strong> While in sunlight,
the dragon has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
<p><strong><em>New Action: Bite.</em></strong> If the dragon deals acid,
cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage with its bite, change that
damage type to necrotic.</p>
<p><strong><em>New Action: Shadow Breath.</em></strong> Any
damage-dealing breath weapon possessed by the dragon deals necrotic
damage instead of its original damage type. A humanoid reduced to 0 hit
points by this damage dies, and an undead shadow rises from its corpse
and acts immediately after the dragon in the initiative count. The
shadow is under the dragon's control.</p>
