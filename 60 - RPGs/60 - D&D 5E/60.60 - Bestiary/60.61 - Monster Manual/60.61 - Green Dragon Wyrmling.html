<h2 id="green-dragon-wyrmling-1">Green Dragon Wyrmling</h2>
<p>The most cunning and treacherous of true dragons, green dragons use
misdirection and trickery to get the upper hand against their enemies.
Nasty tempered and thoroughly evil, they take special pleasure in
subverting and corrupting the good-hearted. In the ancient forests they
roam, green dragons demonstrate an aggression that is often less about
territory than it is about gaining power and wealth with as little
effort as possible.</p>
<p>A green dragon is recognized by its curved jawline and the crest that
begins near its eyes and continues down its spine, reaching full height
just behind the skull. A green dragon has no external ears, but bears
leathery spiked plates that run down the sides of its neck.</p>
<p>A wyrmling green dragon's thin scales are a shade of green so dark as
to appear nearly black. As a green dragon ages, its scales grow larger
and lighter, turning shades of forest, emerald, and olive green to help
it blend in with its wooded surroundings. Its wings have a dappled
pattern, darker near the leading edges and lighter toward the trailing
edges.</p>
<p>A green dragon's legs are longer in relation to its body than with
any other dragon, enabling it to easily pass over underbrush and forest
debris when it walks. With its equally long neck, an older green dragon
can peer over the tops of trees without rearing up.</p>
<p><strong><em>Capricious Hunters.</em></strong> A green dragon hunts by
patrolling its forest territory from the air and the ground. It eats any
creature it can see, and will consume shrubs and small trees when hungry
enough, but its favorite prey is elves.</p>
<p>Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They
favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle
manipulations when dealing with other dragons. A green dragon attacks
animals and monsters with no provocation, especially when dealing with
potential threats to its territory. When dealing with sentient
creatures, a green dragon demonstrates a lust for power that rivals its
draconic desire for treasure, and it is always on the lookout for
creatures that can help it further its ambitions.</p>
<p>A green dragon stalks its victims as it plans its assault, sometimes
shadowing creatures for days. If a target is weak, the dragon enjoys the
terror its appearance evokes before it attacks. It never slays all its
foes, preferring to use intimidation to establish control over
survivors. It then learns what it can about other creatures' activities
near its territory, and about any treasure to be found nearby. Green
dragons occasionally release prisoners if they can be ransomed.
Otherwise, a creature must prove its value to the dragon daily or
die.</p>
<p><strong><em>Manipulative Schemers.</em></strong> A wily and subtle
creature, a green dragon bends other creatures to its will by assessing
and playing off their deepest desires. Any creature foolish enough to
attempt to subdue a green dragon eventually realizes that the creature
is only pretending to serve while it assesses its would-be master.</p>
<p>When manipulating other creatures, green dragons are honey-tongued,
smooth, and sophisticated. Among their own kind, they are loud, crass,
and rude, especially when dealing with dragons of the same age and
status.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conflict and Corruption.</em></strong> Green dragons
sometimes clash with other dragons over territory where forest crosses
over into other terrain. A green dragon typically pretends to back down,
only to wait and watch-sometimes for decades-for the chance to slay the
other dragon, then claim its lair and hoard.</p>
<p>Green dragons accept the servitude of sentient creatures such as
goblinoids, ettercaps, ettins, kobolds, orcs, and yuan-ti. They also
delight in corrupting and bending elves to their will. A green dragon
sometimes wracks its minions' minds with fear to the point of insanity,
with the fog that spreads throughout its forest reflecting those
minions' tortured dreams.</p>
<p><strong><em>Living Treasures.</em></strong> A green dragon's favored
treasures are the sentient creatures it bends to its will, including
significant figures such as popular heroes, well-known sages, and
renowned bards. Among material treasures, a green dragon favors
emeralds, wood carvings, musical instruments, and sculptures of humanoid
subjects.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Green Dragon's Lair.</em></strong> The forest-loving
green dragons sometimes compete for territory with black dragons in
marshy woods and with white dragons in subarctic taiga. However, a
forest controlled by a green dragon is easy to spot. A perpetual fog
hangs in the air in a legendary green dragon's wood, carrying an acrid
whiff of the creature's poison breath.</p>
<p>The moss-covered trees grow close together except where winding
pathways trace their way like a maze into the heart of the forest. The
light that reaches the forest floor carries an emerald green cast, and
every sound seems muffled.</p>
<p>At the center of its forest, a green dragon chooses a cave in a sheer
cliff or hillside for its lair, preferring an entrance hidden from
prying eyes. Some seek out cave mouths concealed behind waterfalls, or
partly submerged caverns that can be accessed through lakes or streams.
Others conceal the entrances to their lairs with vegetation.</p>
<h3 id="chromatic-dragons">Chromatic Dragons</h3>
<p>The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil
side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons
are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including
each other.</p>
<h4 id="driven-by-greed">Driven by Greed</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their
every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to
them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard
for the humanoids and other creatures that have "stolen" it. With its
piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the
stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in
commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.</p>
<h4 id="creatures-of-ego">Creatures of Ego</h4>
<p>Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing
themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When
they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own
interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief
is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and
worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to
convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are
animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy
of respect.</p>
<h4 id="dangerous-lairs">Dangerous Lairs</h4>
<p>A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its
treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe
environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter
but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for
its hoard.</p>
<p>Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote
locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching
them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a
red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to
the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use
magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their
treasures.</p>
<h4 id="queen-of-evil-dragons">Queen of Evil Dragons</h4>
<p>Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She
dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god,
Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is
loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons,
believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers
and hers alone.</p>
<p>Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the
chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white.
She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies
with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her
fearsome claws.</p>
<p>Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom
she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special
enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus
and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.</p>
<p>True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome
power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed,
with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures
in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power
fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural
abilities.</p>
<p>Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic
blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of
chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white
dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper,
gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the
wise.</p>
<p>Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons
covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and
magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long,
venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.</p>
<p>True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly
wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years.
In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow
beyond price.</p>
