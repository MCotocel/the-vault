<p><em>Medium monstrosity, chaotic evil</em> <strong><em> -
<strong>Armor Class</strong> 11 - <strong>Hit Points</strong> 38 (7d8 +

<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The harpy makes two attacks:
one with its claws and one with its club.</p>
<p><strong><em>Claws.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Club.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning
damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Luring Song.</em></strong> The harpy sings a magical
melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can
hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed
until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its
subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time.
The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated. While charmed by the harpy,
a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the
charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must
move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't
avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such
as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than
the harpy, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's
saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it. A target that
successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24
hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="harpy-1">Harpy</h2>
<p>Taking glee in suffering and death, the sadistic harpy is always on
the hunt for prey. Its sweet song has lured countless adventurers to
their deaths, drawing them in close for the harpy to kill and then
consume.</p>
<p>A harpy combines the body, legs, and wings of a vulture with the
torso, arms, and head of a human. Its wicked talons and bone club make
it a formidable threat in combat, and its eyes reflect the absolute evil
of its soul.</p>
<p><strong><em>Divine Curse.</em></strong> Long ago, an elf wandering a
forest heard birdsong so pure and wholesome that she was moved to tears.
Following the music, she came upon a clearing where stood a handsome elf
youth who had also paused to hear the bird's song. This was Fenmarel
Mestarine, a reclusive elf god. His divine presence stole her heart as
he fled, vanishing into the woods as if he was never there.</p>
<p>Though the elf searched the woods and called for her stranger, she
found no sign of his passage. Driven to despair by her longing, she
begged the gods to help her. Aerdrie Faenya, elf goddess of the sky,
heard the elf's cries and was moved to her aid. She appeared as the bird
whose song had entranced the outcast god, then taught that song of
beauty and seduction to the elf.</p>
<p>When her singing failed to draw Fenmarel Mestarine to her side, the
elf cursed the gods, invoking a dreadful power and transforming her into
the first harpy. The curse worked its magic on the elf's spirit as well
as her body, turning her desire for love into a hunger for flesh, even
as her beautiful song continued to draw creatures to her deadly
embrace.</p>
<p><strong><em>Harpy Song.</em></strong> To hear a harpy's song is to
hear music more beautiful than anything else in the world. A traveler
that succumbs to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to
blunder toward its source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it
attacks, but a more effective use of its song is to lure prey over
cliffs, into bogs and quicksand, or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped
or incapacitated then become easy targets for the harpy's wrath.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sadistic Cowards.</em></strong> Harpies haunt bleak
coastal cliffs and other places hazardous to non-flying creatures.
Harpies have no interest in a fair fight, and they never attack unless
they have a clear advantage. If a fight turns against a harpy, it lacks
the cunning to adapt and will flee and go hungry rather than risk
straight-up combat.</p>
<p>When they attack, harpies play with their food, delighting in the
"music" their victims make as they scream. A harpy takes its time
dismembering a helpless foe and can spend days torturing a victim before
the merciful end.</p>
<p><strong><em>Gruesome Collectors.</em></strong> Harpies take shiny
baubles, valuable objects, and other trophies from their victims,
sometimes fighting with each other for the right to claim the choicest
prizes. When no valuable objects can be found, a harpy takes hair,
bones, or body parts to line its nest. A harpy's lair is usually hidden
in remote ruins, where adventurers can discover valuable treasure and
magic hidden beneath foul piles of offal.</p>
