<h2 id="ettin-1">Ettin</h2>
<p>An ettin is a foul, two-headed giant with the crude characteristics
of an orc. It never bathes if it can help it, and its thick skin is
usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime beneath the
stinking hides it wears. Its long stringy hair hangs in an unkempt mess
about its faces, and its breath reeks from mouths filled with crooked
teeth and tusks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Dual Personality.</em></strong> The twin heads of an
ettin are two individuals trapped in the same brutish body. Each head
has its own mind, personality, and name, and possesses unique
preferences and quirks. Bound from birth, both minds only rarely
experience privacy or solitude. This familiarity breeds contempt, and an
ettin bullies and argues with itself constantly, its two heads each
taking constant offense at the other's slights.</p>
<p>When other creatures refer to an ettin, they combine its double names
to form a single compound name that applies to the creature as a whole.
If an ettin has one head named Hargle and another named Vargle, other
creatures call the ettin Harglevargle.</p>
<p><strong><em>Solitary Lives.</em></strong> As much as an ettin argues
with itself, it is even less tolerant of other ettins, since a
conversation between two ettins almost always amounts to a shouting
match between a crowd of four belligerent heads. Most ettins are
solitary creatures as a result, tolerating one another only to
reproduce.</p>
<p>An ettin's twin heads are always the same gender, with a body to
match.</p>
<p>Females are the dominant gender among ettins, and they initiate the
ettins' mating rituals. After finding a suitable den, a female ettin
hunts and conquers a male, which cares for and feeds her during her
six-month pregnancy. Once the child is born, the male ettin is released
from servitude. When the child is old enough to hunt for itself, the
mother sends it away and abandons the den.</p>
<p><strong><em>Two Heads are Better than One.</em></strong> When focused
on a mutually beneficial purpose or united by a common threat, an ettin
can resolve its personality differences and dedicate itself fully to a
task. An ettin fights with a weapon in each hand, making twin attacks
directed by its respective heads. When an ettin sleeps, one of its heads
remains ever alert, gaining its only moments of privacy and keeping two
eyes open for any creature that disturbs its precious solitude.</p>
<p><strong><em>Orcish Ties.</em></strong> In ancient dialects of Common,
the word "ettin" translates as "ugly giant." Legends tell of orcs that
once stumbled upon a temple to Demogorgon, the magic of which
transformed them into giant mockeries of the twin-headed Prince of
Demons. Driven to near madness, these creatures scattered into the
wilderness to become the first ettins.</p>
<p>Whatever the truth of the ettins' origin, orcs treat them as distant
cousins, and orc tribes often entice ettins to serve as guards, scouts,
and marauders. An ettin isn't particularly loyal to its orc handlers,
but the orcs can win it over with the promise of food and loot.</p>
