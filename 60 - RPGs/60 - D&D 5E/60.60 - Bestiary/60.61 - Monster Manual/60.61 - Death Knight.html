<strong><em>Magic Resistance.</em></strong> The death knight has
advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Marshal Undead.</em></strong> Unless the death knight is
incapacitated, it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of
it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn
undead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Spellcasting.</em></strong> The death knight is a
19th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save
DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following paladin
spells prepared:</p>
<p>1st level (4 slots): <em>command</em>, <em>compelled duel</em>,
<em>searing smite</em> 2nd level (3 slots): <em>hold person</em>,
<em>magic weapon</em> 3rd level (3 slots): <em>dispel magic</em>,
<em>elemental weapon</em> 4th level (3 slots): <em>banishment</em>,
<em>staggering smite</em> 5th level (2 slots): <em>destructive wave</em>
(necrotic)</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The death knight makes three
longsword attacks.</p>
<p><strong><em>Longsword.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em>
+11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing
damage, or 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18
(4d8) necrotic damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Hellfire Orb (1/Day).</em></strong> The death knight
hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within
120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on
that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads
around corners. A creature takes 35 (10d6) fire damage and 35 (10d6)
necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.</p>
<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Parry.</em></strong> The death knight adds 6 to its AC
against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the death knight
must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="death-knight-1">Death Knight</h2>
<p>When a paladin that falls from grace dies without seeking atonement,
dark powers can transform the once-mortal knight into a hateful undead
creature. A death knight is a skeletal warrior clad in fearsome plate
armor. Beneath its helmet, one can see the knight's skull with
malevolent pinpoints of light burning in its eye sockets.</p>
<p><strong><em>Eldritch Power.</em></strong> The death knight retains
the ability to cast divine spells. However, no death knight can use its
magic to heal. A death knight also attracts and commands lesser undead,
although death knights that serve powerful fiends might have fiendish
followers instead. Death knights often use warhorse skeletons and
nightmares as mounts.</p>
<p><strong><em>Immortal Until Redeemed.</em></strong> A death knight can
arise anew even after it has been destroyed. Only when it atones for a
life of wickedness or finds redemption can it finally escape its undead
purgatory and truly perish.</p>
<p><strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A death knight doesn't
require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="lord-soth">Lord Soth</h5>
<p>Lord Soth began his fall from grace with an act of heroism, saving an
elf named Isolde from an ogre. Soth and Isolde fell in love, but Soth
was already married. He had a servant dispose of his wife and was
charged with murder, but fled with Isolde. When his castle fell under
siege, he prayed for guidance and was told that he must atone for his
misdeeds by completing a quest, but growing fears about Isolde's
fidelity caused him to abandon his quest. Because his mission was not
accomplished, a great cataclysm swept the land. When Isolde gave birth
to a son, Soth refused to believe that the child was his and slew them
both. All were incinerated in a fire that swept through the castle, yet
Soth would find no rest in death, becoming a death knight.</p>
