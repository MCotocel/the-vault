<h2 id="cloud-giant-1">Cloud Giant</h2>
<p>Cloud giants live extravagant lives high above the world, showing
little concern for the plights of other races except as amusement. They
are muscular with light skin and have hair of silver or blue.</p>
<p><strong><em>High and Mighty.</em></strong> Cloud giants are spread to
the winds, encompassing vast areas of the world. In times of need,
scattered cloud giant families band together as a unified clan. However,
they can seldom do so quickly.</p>
<p>Attuned to the magic of their airy domains, cloud giants are able to
turn into mist and create clouds of billowing fog. They dwell in castles
on high mountain peaks, or on the solid clouds that once held their
fiefs.</p>
<p>Still gracing the skies on occasion, these magic clouds are a lasting
remnant of the giants' lost empires. Better spellcasters than most other
giants, some cloud giants can control weather, bring storms, and steer
the wind almost as well as their cousins, the storm giants.</p>
<p><strong><em>Affluent Princes.</em></strong> Although cloud giants are
lower in the ordning than storm giants, the reclusive storm giants
rarely engage with the rest of giantkind. As a result, many cloud giants
see themselves as having the highest status and power among the giant
races.</p>
<p>They order lesser giants to seek out wealth and art on their behalf,
employing fire giants as smiths and crafters, and using frost giants as
reavers, raiders, and plunderers. Dimwitted hill giants serve them as
brutes and combat fodder-sometimes fighting for the cloud giants'
amusement. A cloud giant might order hill or frost giants to steal from
nearby humanoid lands, which it considers to be a fair tax for its
continued beneficence. On their mountain summits and solid clouds, cloud
giants keep extraordinary gardens. Grapes as big as apples grow there,
along with apples the size of pumpkins, and pumpkins the size of wagons.
From the errant seeds of these gardens, tales of cottage sized produce
and magic beans are spread in the mortal realm.</p>
<p>As humanoid nobles keep an aerie for hunting hawks, so do cloud
giants keep griffons, perytons, and wyverns as their own flying beasts
of prey. Such creatures also patrol the cloud giants' gardens by night,
along with trained predators such as owlbears and lions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Children of the Trickster.</em></strong> The patron god
and father of the cloud giants is Memnor the Trickster, the cleverest
and slyest of the giant deities. Cloud giants align themselves according
to the aspects and exploits of Memnor that they most admire, with evil
cloud giants emulating his deceitfulness and self-interest and good
cloud giants emulating his intellect and silver-tongued speech. Family
members usually align in the same direction.</p>
<p><strong><em>Wealth and Power.</em></strong> A cloud giant earns its
place in the ordning by the treasure it accumulates, the wealth it
wears, and the gifts it bestows on other cloud giants.</p>
<p>However, value is only one part of the assessment. The extravagances
a cloud giant wears or places about its home must also be beautiful or
wondrous. Sacks of gold or gems are worth less to a cloud giant than the
jewelry that might be crafted from those materials, creating treasures
that bring esteem to a cloud giant's household.</p>
<p>Rather than steal from one another or fight over treasures, cloud
giants are inveterate gamblers with a hunger for high risks and high
rewards. They frequently bet on the outcome of events nominally outside
their control, such as the lives of lesser creatures. Ordning ranks and
kings' ransoms can be won and lost in bets over the military triumphs of
humanoid nations. Fixing wagers by interfering in the conflict causes
the loss of the bet, but such deceit is considered to be cheating only
if it is discovered. Otherwise, it is cleverness honoring Memnor.</p>
<h1 id="giants">Giants</h1>
<p>Ancient empires once cast long shadows over a world that quaked
beneath the giants' feet. In those lost days, these towering figures
were dragon slayers, dreamers, crafters, and kings, but their kind fell
from glory long ago. However, even divided among secluded clans
scattered throughout the world, the giants maintain the customs and
traditions of old.</p>
<h3 id="old-as-legend">Old as Legend</h3>
<p>In remote regions of the world, the last remaining plinths,
monoliths, and statues of the great giant empires bow their heads in
desolate obscurity. Where once those empires sprawled across all lands,
now the giants dwell in isolated tribes and clans.</p>
<p>Giants are almost as old as dragons, which were still young when the
giants' heavy feet first shook the foundations of the world. As they
spread across new lands, giants and dragons fought bitter generational
wars that nearly brought both sides low. No living giant remembers what
started the conflict, but myths and tales of their race's glorious dawn
are still sung in their steadings and holdfasts, vilifying the primeval
wyrms. Giants and dragons continue to harbor grudges against one
another, and it is seldom that they will meet or occupy the same area
without a fight.</p>
<h3 id="the-ordning">The Ordning</h3>
<p>Each of the main giant races-the cloud, fire, frost, hill, stone, and
storm giants-are related by common elements of history, religion, and
culture. They view one another as kindred, keeping any inherent
animosity over territory and ambition to a minimum.</p>
<p>Giants belong to a caste structure called the ordning. Based on
social class and highly organized, the ordning assigns a social rank to
each giant. By understanding its place in the ordning, a giant knows
which other giants are inferior or superior to it, since no two giants
are equal. Each of the giant races analyzes a different combination of
skills or qualities to determine the ordning. Giants make excelling in
these qualities the purpose of their lives.</p>
<p>At the highest level of the ordning, the races of the giants are also
ranked according to status. Storm giants are the highest in the ordning,
followed by cloud giants, fire giants, frost giants, stone giants, hill
giants, and finally giant kin such as fomorians, ettins, and ogres.</p>
<p>Regardless of a giant's rank among its own race, the chief of a hill
giant tribe is inferior to the most common of stone giants. The lowest
ranked giant of any type is superior to the highest ranked giant of an
inferior type. It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a
giant of another type, merely rude.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 id="giant-gods">Giant Gods</h5>
<p>When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants,
forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either
again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their
birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam
but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly
villains that make up the giants' pantheon.</p>
<p>Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons
represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for
cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost
giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all
giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many
good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm
giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage
to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to
Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden;
Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and
arrogant trickster.</p>
<p>Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults,
paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other
non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain
to make a giant an outcast.</p>
