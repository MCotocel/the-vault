<h2 id="draft">Draft:</h2>
<p>[Slide 1] I'd just like to preface this by letting you all know that
I wrote this at 1 AM while half-asleep, so don't judge it too
harshly.</p>
<p>[Slide 2] Anyway, I was assigned the chapter "Banks of the creek",
and it mainly focuses of the industries the UAE has been in.</p>
<p>[Slide 3] So, the economy of the UAE has long depended on the pearl
industry. These pearls were sought after by divers, taking risks in
order to find one of the precious gems of the sea. However, pearl diving
wasn't the only industry that the UAE delved into. The UAE was an
important transit point for trading around the world. Ships would come
to the ports to leave and take cargo all around the world.</p>
<p>[Slide 4] However, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the
demand for natural pearls collapsed. Additionally, Japan's cultured
pearls, which were much cheaper than real pearls, played a part in the
collapse of the pearl industry.</p>
<p>Due to this, the UAE shifted to transporting cargo and fishing. This
was further benefited by the fact that early on, the UAE had a tax-free
economy.</p>
<p>[Slide 5] In 1937, the UAE signed an agreement for sole
proprietorship of oil exploration in the country. It took 20 months to
negotiate, and granted the UAE rights to exploration for a total of 75
years, with an annual royalty of 30k Indian rupees. However, oil was not
found, and the UAE put the project on hold.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, at one point, gold was implied to be smuggled
into and out of the Indian subcontinent by the news, but it was actually
legally imported and exported.</p>
<p>[Slide 6] At some point, they built something called 'The creek' was
a 14lkm long harbour, made for small and medium-sized dhows. Ships
loaded with up to 800 tonnes of goods could use the creek's facilities.
In 1987, the number of berths was increased to 35, allowing more ships
to use the harbour.</p>
<p>[Slide 7] In 1966, oil was discovered at the Fateh field. The first
oil shipment left on the 22nd of September, 1969. This marked the
beginning of the UAE's success in the industry of oil.</p>
<p>[Slide 8] I found this chapter pretty interesting, since it went into
detail about what the UAE did before they discovered oil. However, at
times it kinda went off on a tangent, like that bit about gold I
mentioned earlier. Still, overall, pretty good chapter.</p>
