<p><a
href="https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html">They're
made out of meat</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They're made out of meat.</p>
<p>Meat?</p>
<p>Meat. They're made out of meat.</p>
<p>Meat?</p>
<p>There's no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts of
the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way
through. They're completely meat.</p>
<p>That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the
stars.</p>
<p>They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from
them. The signals come from machines.</p>
<p>So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact.</p>
<p>They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made
the machines.</p>
<p>That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to
believe in sentient meat.</p>
<p>I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only
sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat.</p>
<p>Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence
that goes through a meat stage.</p>
<p>Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for
several of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any
idea the life span of meat?</p>
<p>Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the
Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside.</p>
<p>Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the
Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way
through.</p>
<p>No brain?</p>
<p>Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out
of meat!</p>
<p>So... what does the thinking?</p>
<p>You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The
meat.</p>
<p>Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!</p>
<p>Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The
meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?</p>
<p>Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat.</p>
<p>Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying
to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years.</p>
<p>So what does the meat have in mind.</p>
<p>First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the
universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The
usual.</p>
<p>We're supposed to talk to meat?</p>
<p>That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio.
'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing.</p>
<p>They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?</p>
<p>Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat.</p>
<p>I thought you just told me they used radio.</p>
<p>They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know
how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping
their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through
their meat.</p>
<p>Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you
advise?</p>
<p>Officially or unofficially?</p>
<p>Both.</p>
<p>Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and
all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice,
fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and
forget the whole thing.</p>
<p>I was hoping you would say that.</p>
<p>It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make
contact with meat?</p>
<p>I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?" 'Hello, meat.
How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing
with here?</p>
<p>Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat
containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only
travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and
makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim.
Infinitesimal, in fact.</p>
<p>So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones
who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure
they won't remember?</p>
<p>They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads
and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them.</p>
<p>A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's
dream.</p>
<p>And we can marked this sector unoccupied.</p>
<p>Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others?
Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?</p>
<p>Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a
class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotation ago,
wants to be friendly again.</p>
<p>They always come around.</p>
<p>And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the
universe would be if one were all alone.</p>
