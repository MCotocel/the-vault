<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>War has long been glorified, through manipulation of a sense of
patriotism and honour and by causing young men to feel guilty for not
serving their country via enlisting in the army. Even now, the military
entices young men into signing up and going to a faraway country, simply
to kill others. Like flies to honey, with potential soldiers the flies,
and the presumed benefits the honey, the military sweetens the pot with
promises of discharged student loans, education benefits, and cash
bonuses, while placing guilt upon those who don't enlist. This is shown
both in the poem <em>Disabled</em> by Wilfred Owen, written during World
War I and published after his death, and through the notorious <em>Lord
Kitchener Wants You</em> poster, created in World War I and spawning
countless imitations.</p>
<h1 id="disabled">Disabled</h1>
<p><em>Disabled</em> is a poem by the English poet Wilfred Owen. It is
about the aftermath of World War I, and how veterans were treated when
they came back from the war. In <em>Disabled</em>, it is clear that at
least part of the poem is about the various things done to convince men
to enlist. For example, the lines "He thought of jewelled hilts / For
daggers in plaid socks" shows that the soldiers anticipated glory and
rewards when they joined, further emphasized by jewelled, since jewels
are expensive, but in reality didn't truly know <em>what</em> to expect.
Alongside that, later in the poem it is said that "he was drafted out
with drums and cheers". This shows that even up to the moment before
they were drafted, the illusion of grandeur was being cast upon the
soldiers, fooling them up until it was too late for them. It is obvious
that these lines show the glorification of war during World War I
negatively, especially since <em>Disabled</em> was intended to show the
dark side of the war.</p>
<h1 id="lord-kitchener-wants-you">Lord Kitchener Wants You</h1>
<p><em>Lord Kitchener Wants You</em> is an iconic poster, also from
World War I. It was a recruitment poster that was intended to encourage
young men to join the army. It depicted the British Secretary of State
for War, Lord Kitchener, pointing at you, with text below saying "Wants
you", and in red, "Join your country's army! / God save the king". Usage
of "your" makes the person reading the poster feel that since the
country they are in is "theirs", they are obligated to protect it.
Additionally, the poster was designed specifically so that the eyes and
finger seem to follow the viewer, no matter their orientation relative
to the poster. From this, it is reasonable to assume that it was
designed to cause guilt in people, leading to them enlisting in the
army.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Throughout the two examples, it is evident that they display how war
was glorified. <em>Disabled</em> casts this whole process in a negative
light, however, the <em>Lord Kitchener Wants You</em> poster casts war
in a positive light, in order to persuade citizens into joining the
army. From these examples, it is logical to view glorification of war as
a global issue, since the victims potentially don't realize that they
<em>are</em> victims until it is far too late.</p>
