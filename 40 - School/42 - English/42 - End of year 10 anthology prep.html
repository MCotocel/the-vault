<h1
id="in-beyond-the-sky-and-earth-how-does-zeppa-present-her-experience-in-bhutan">In
'Beyond the Sky and Earth', how does Zeppa present her experience in
Bhutan?</h1>
<p>Zeppa presents her experience in Bhutan in 'Beyond the Sky and Earth'
by using a variety of vocabulary choices. For example, at the beginning,
she writes: "I watch mountains rise to meet the moon". This statement
implies that she is in awe of the mountains, since she is watching them,
observing them reaching for the moon, a faraway object. Additionally,
since the mountains are rising to "meet the moon", she may feel
claustrophobic and suffocated by them, due to them being huge in
comparison to the surroundings.</p>
<p>Later on in the extract, she says "I stay close to them, hoping to
pick up some of their enthusiasm". Her hoping to become more
enthusiastic about Bhutan shows that she isn't already enthusiastic,
implying that she's underwhelmed by the town and doesn't like what she
has seen so far. This tells us that her experience has not been great up
to this point, and she may possibly regret going to Bhutan.</p>
<p>At the end, Zeppa states that she is "full of admiration for this
small country". This clearly shows that her opinions on Bhutan have
changed, and that she appreciates and enjoys it. This is shown through
usage of the word 'admiration', which implies that she has been
impressed by the small town.</p>
<h1
id="in-h-is-for-hawk-how-does-the-writer-use-language-and-structure-to-interest-and-engage-the-reader">In
'H is for Hawk' how does the writer use language and structure to
interest and engage the reader?</h1>
<p>The writer uses foreshadowing to interest the reader in 'H is for
Hawk'. For example, the quote "Don't want you going home with the wrong
bird" hints to the reader that exactly that may happen. The fact that it
is a line of dialogue that is seemingly out of place causes most readers
to overlook it, thinking it unimportant. However, it does foreshadow the
ending of the extract, where she almost does go home with the wrong
bird.</p>
<p>Furthermore, suspense and tension is also used in the extract. An
example of this is shown in the quote "Scratching talons, another thump.
And another. <em>Thump</em>". The use of short, brief sentences builds
tension throughout the paragraph, engaging the reader and making them
curious as to what happens next. Additionally, the use of onomatopoeia
in '<em>thump</em>' shows that something is moving, along with implying
that the hawk is aggressive due to its hostile sounds.</p>
<p>The author further engages the reader by adding a turning point. This
occurs when the quote "It was the wrong bird" is said. The quote inserts
a twist into the extract, surprising the reader and making them eager to
read on in order to see what happens. Additionally, a short while later
the interjection of "<em>Oh.</em>" shows that the writer was
disappointed, interesting the reader as to why that is, yet again
convincing them to read more of the extract.</p>
<h1
id="how-does-the-writer-use-language-and-structure-in-explorers-or-boys-messing-about-to-show-what-people-thought-about-the-actions-of-the-two-explorers">How
does the writer use language and structure in 'Explorers or boys messing
about?' to show what people thought about the actions of the two
explorers?</h1>
<p>The writer uses cartoonish imagery to show what is thought of the two
explorers. This is shown when the verbs 'plunged' and 'plucked' are
used. These show that the explorers were treated like helpless children,
since not only are cartoons mainly for children, they are also portrayed
as unable to save themselves from their crash and needed to be 'plucked'
from the sea.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the two men are heavily mocked in the extract. An
example of this is shown when it is said that they were "boys messing
around with a helicopter". Not only does this portray them in an
infantile manner, as if unable to do anything, it also mocks them and
implies that they were clueless and did not know what they were doing
when flying the helicopter.</p>
<p>The writer further discredits the explorers through the line "It
sounds as if they were pushing it [the helicopter] to the maximum". This
discredits the two men by showing that they were not prepared to fly a
helicopter out into the sea, and took unnecessary risks when doing it as
well. Additionally, they are further discredited in the quote "The
flying conditions had been 'excellent'". This implies that even if it
should have been simple to fly a helicopter under these circumstances,
the explorers managed to fail even then, which discredits them.</p>
